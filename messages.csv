"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, and it is transmitted through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito.",FEDGEN-PHIS
Malaria is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical countries., WHO website
The risk of death for severe malaria is greatest in the first twenty four hours.,FMOH
"According to the World Health Organisation year two thousand and twenty four Malaria Report, Africa accounts for a more significant percentage of the world malaria burden,
accounting for ninety four percent and ninety five percent of estimated malaria cases and deaths worldwide in year two thousand and twenty three, with Nigeria at the forefront.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread
to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.", WHO website
"Effective prevention strategies include using insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and prompt access to antimalarial treatment.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"In year two thousand and twenty three, an estimated two hundred and sixty three million people contracted malaria in eighty three countries.", WHO website
"However, many individuals, particularly in low-income households, face significant barriers to implementing these preventive measures.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"The risk of malaria is increased by poverty, inadequate housing, and limited awareness.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Low-income households often cannot afford mosquito-proofing measures, making them more susceptible to bites.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"It is preventable and curable.", WHO website
What is malaria and how is it transmitted?, WHO website
"However, without prompt diagnosis and effective treatment, a case of
uncomplicated malaria can progress to a severe form of the disease, which is often fatal without
treatment.", WHO website
"Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another; the disease is
transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes.", WHO website
"Five species of parasites can
cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
vivax – pose the greatest threat.", WHO website
"This risk of infection is higher in some areas than others depending on multiple factors,
including the type of local mosquitoes.", WHO website
"It may also vary according to the season, the risk being
highest during the rainy season in tropical countries.", WHO website
Who is at risk of malaria?, WHO website
Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria., WHO website
"That same year, the disease claimed approximately
five hundred and ninety seven thousand lives.", WHO website
Some people are more susceptible to developing severe malaria than others., WHO website
"Infants and
children under five years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV/AIDS are at particular
risk.", WHO website
"Other vulnerable groups include people entering areas with intense malaria transmission who have not acquired partial immunity from long exposure to the disease, or who are not
taking chemopreventive therapies, such as migrants, mobile populations and travellers.", WHO website
Some people in areas where malaria is common will develop partial immunity., WHO website
"While it never
provides complete protection, partial immunity reduces the risk that malaria infection will
cause severe disease.", WHO website
"For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk.", WHO website
What are the symptoms and how is it diagnosed?, WHO website
"The first symptoms of malaria usually begin within 10–15 days after the bite from an infected
mosquito.", WHO website
"Fever, headache and chills are typically experienced, though these symptoms may
be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria.", WHO website
"In malaria endemic areas, people who have
developed partial immunity may become infected but experience no symptoms (asymptomatic
infections).", WHO website
World Health Organization recommends prompt diagnosis for anyone with suspected malaria., WHO website
"If Plasmodium
falciparum malaria is not treated within twenty four hours, the infection can progress to severe illness
and death.", WHO website
"Severe malaria can cause multi-organ failure in adults, while children frequently
suffer from severe anaemia, respiratory distress or cerebral malaria.", WHO website
"Human malaria caused by
other Plasmodium species can cause significant illness and occasionally life-threatening
disease.", WHO website
Malaria can be diagnosed using tests that determine the presence of the parasites causing the disease., WHO website
"There are two main types of tests: microscopic examination of blood smears and rapid
diagnostic tests.", WHO website
"Diagnostic testing enables health providers to distinguish malarial from other
causes of febrile illnesses, facilitating appropriate treatment.", WHO website
"What treatments are available for malaria
Malaria is a treatable disease.", WHO website
"Artemisinin-based combination therapies Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are the most
effective antimalarial medicines available today and the mainstay of recommended treatment
for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest malaria parasite globally.", WHO website
"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies combine 2 active pharmaceuticals with different mechanisms of action, including
derivates of artemisinin extracted from the plant Artemisia annua and a partner drug.", WHO website
"The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first three days of treatment, while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites.", WHO website
"As no alternative to artemisinin derivatives is expected to enter the market for several years,
the efficacy of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies must be preserved, which is why World Health Organization recommends that treatment should
only be administered if a person tests positive for malaria.", WHO website
"World Health Organization does not support the
promotion or use of Artemisia plant material (whether teas, tablets or capsules) for the
prevention or treatment of malaria.", WHO website
"The emergence and spread of artemisinin partial resistance – defined as delayed clearance after
treatment with a drug containing an artemisinin – and resistance to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy partner drugs are
significant threats to efforts aimed at reducing the global burden of malaria.", WHO website
"In Africa, artemisinin partial resistance is now confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania and is suspected in Ethiopia, Sudan, Namibia and Zambia.", WHO website
"Although studies generally show high efficacy of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies, concerns remain regarding both the quality and
coverage of efficacy data.", WHO website
"As part of the World Health Organization strategy to respond to the threat of antimalarial
drug resistance in Africa, World Health Organization calls on malaria endemic countries and global malaria partners
to strengthen the surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance, and to ensure that
the most effective treatments are selected for national treatment policy.", WHO website
Where is malaria most prevalent?, WHO website
Malaria occurs primarily in tropical and subtropical countries., WHO website
"The vast majority of malaria
cases and deaths are found in the World Health Organization African Region, with nearly all cases caused by the
Plasmodium falciparum parasite.", WHO website
"This parasite is also dominant in other malaria hotspots,
including the World Health Organization regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific.", WHO website
"In the World Health Organization Region of the Americas, the Plasmodium vivax parasite is predominant.", WHO website
"The threat of malaria is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and four countries in that region accounted for over half of all malaria deaths worldwide in year two thousand and twenty three: Nigeria (thirty point nine percent ), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (eleven point three percent ), Niger (five point nine percent ) and the United Republic of Tanzania four point three percent).", WHO website
Is it dangerous to travel to places where malaria is endemic?, WHO website
People who have no partial immunity to malaria are at higher risk of contracting the disease., WHO website
"This includes travellers from non-endemic countries entering areas of high transmission as well
as people in malaria-endemic countries living in areas where there is little or no transmission.", WHO website
"As symptoms often do not present for ten to fifteen days after infection, travellers may return to
their home country before exhibiting signs of the disease.", WHO website
"Doctors in non-endemic areas may
not recognize the symptoms, causing potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment.", WHO website
"In
addition, effective antimalarial drugs may not be registered or available in all countries.", WHO website
Chemoprophylaxis can be used as a preventive therapy prior to travelling in endemic areas., WHO website
"When combined with the use of insecticide-treated nets and the repeated application of a topical
repellent to prevent mosquito bites, it significantly lowers the risk of infection.", WHO website
"If a person has
taken chemoprophylaxis as a preventive measure, the same medicine should not be used for
treatment if infection occurs.", WHO website
"Travellers are encouraged to consult a doctor or their national disease control centre prior to
departure to determine the appropriate preventive measures.", WHO website
How can malaria be prevented?, WHO website
"Malaria is a preventable disease.
1.", WHO website
"Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and
reduce transmission.", WHO website
"Two forms of vector control are effective for people living in malaria-
endemic countries: insecticide-treated nets, which prevent bites while people sleep and which
kill mosquitoes as they try to feed, and indoor residual spraying, which is the application of an
insecticide to surfaces where mosquitoes tend to rest, such as internal walls, eaves and ceilings
of houses and other domestic structures.", WHO website
"For travellers, the use of an insecticide-treated net is
the most practical vector control intervention.", WHO website
"World Health Organization maintains a list vector control products
that have been assessed for their safety, effectiveness and quality.", WHO website
"Although designed to treat patients
already infected with malaria, some antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent the
disease.", WHO website
"Current World Health Organization-recommended malaria chemopreventive therapies for people living in
endemic areas include intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, perennial
malaria chemoprevention, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, post-discharge malaria
chemoprevention, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for school-aged children.", WHO website
"Chemoprophylaxis drugs are also given to travellers before entering an area where malaria is
endemic and can be highly effective when combined with insecticide-treated nets.", WHO website
Is there a vaccine against malaria?, WHO website
"In year two thousand and twenty one, World Health Organization recommended the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) vaccine to prevent malaria among
children living in regions with moderate-to-high P. falciparum malaria transmission.", WHO website
"The
vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among
young children.", WHO website
"In October year two thousand and twenty three, World Health Organization recommended a second safe and effective malaria
vaccine, R21/Matrix-M.", WHO website
"Vaccines are now being rolled out in routine childhood immunization
programmes across Africa.", WHO website
"Malaria vaccines in Africa are expected to save tens of thousands
of young lives every year.", WHO website
"The highest impact will be achieved, however, when the vaccines
are introduced alongside a mix of other World Health Organization-recommended malaria interventions such as bed nets and chemoprophylaxis.", WHO website
"Can malaria be eliminated?
The vision of World Health Organization and the global malaria community is a world free of malaria.", WHO website
"This vision
will be achieved progressively by countries eliminating malaria from their territories and
implementing effective measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission.", WHO website
Malaria-endemic countries are situated at different points along the road to elimination., WHO website
"The
rate of progress depends on the strength of the national health system, the level of investment
in malaria elimination strategies and other factors, including biological determinants, the
environment and the social, demographic, political and economic realities of a particular
country.", WHO website
"Over the last two decades, significant progress has been achieved towards malaria elimination.", WHO website
"According to the latest World malaria report, twenty five countries had fewer than ten cases of the disease in year two thousand and twenty three, up from four countries in year two thousand.", WHO website
"Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria
(a case contracted locally with no evidence of importation from another endemic country) are eligible to apply for the World Health Organization certification of malaria elimination.", WHO website
"Since year two thousand and fifteen, fourteen countries
have been certified by the World Health Organization Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives ( year two thousand and fifteen),
Sri Lanka (year two thousand and sixteen), Kyrgyzstan (year two thousand and sixteen), Paraguay (year two thousand and eighteen), Uzbekistan (year two thousand and eighteen), Argentina (year two thousand and nineteen),
Algeria (year two thousand and nineteen), El Salvador (year two thousand and twenty one), China (year two thousand and twenty one), Azerbaijan (year two thousand and twenty three), Tajikistan (year two thousand and twenty three), Cabo
Verde (year two thousand and twenty four), Egypt (year two thousand and twenty four) and Georgia (year two thousand and twenty five).", WHO website
What is the differences between malaria elimination and eradication?, WHO website
"Malaria elimination refers to the interruption of transmission in a given geographical area –
typically a country.", WHO website
"Malaria eradication refers to the complete interruption of malaria
transmission globally, in all countries.", WHO website
"Malaria vaccines (RTS,S and R21)
What is the malaria situation and who is most at risk?", WHO website
"Despite progress, efforts to control malaria face many challenges.", WHO website
"There were an estimated
two hundred and sixty three million new malaria cases and five hundred and ninety seven thousand malaria deaths globally in year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website
"The World Health Organization African
Region continues to shoulder the heaviest malaria burden, comprising ninety four percent  of malaria cases
and ninety five percent  of malaria deaths globally.", WHO website
Children are particularly vulnerable; World Health Organization estimates that about four hundred and thirty two thousand African children died from malaria in year two thousand and twenty three., WHO website
"What is the World Health Organization recommendation for the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines?", WHO website
World Health Organization updated their recommendation for malaria vaccines in October year two thousand and twenty three., WHO website
"The updated recommendation is applicable to both RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccines:
", WHO website
"World Health Organization recommends the use of malaria vaccines for the prevention of P.
falciparum malaria in children living in malaria endemic areas, prioritizing areas of
moderate and high transmission.
", WHO website
"The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from
around 5 months of age. (Vaccination programmes may choose to give the first dose at
a later or slightly earlier age based on operational considerations.)
", WHO website
"A 5th dose, given one year after dose four, may be considered in areas of highly seasonal
transmission or where malaria risk remains high during the third year of life or beyond.
", WHO website
"In areas with highly seasonal malaria transmission or areas with perennial malaria
transmission with seasonal peaks, countries may consider providing the vaccine using
an age-based administration, seasonal administration, or a hybrid of these approaches.
", WHO website
"Countries should prioritize vaccination in areas of moderate and high transmission but
may also consider providing the vaccine in low transmission settings.", WHO website
"Decisions on
expanding to low transmission settings should be considered at a country level, based
on the overall malaria control strategy, cost-effectiveness, affordability, and
programmatic considerations. ", WHO website
"Malaria vaccines should be provided as part of a comprehensive malaria control
strategy.", WHO website
What do we know about the World Health Organization-recommended malaria vaccines?, WHO website
"As of October year two thousand and twenty three, both the RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M vaccines are recommended by World Health Organization to prevent malaria in children.", WHO website
"Malaria vaccines should be provided to children in a
schedule of four doses from around five months of age.", WHO website
"Vaccination programmes may choose to give
the first dose at a later or slightly earlier age based on operational considerations.", WHO website
"The malaria vaccines act against P. falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the
most prevalent in Africa.", WHO website
"The RTS,S malaria vaccine was first recommended by World Health Organization to prevent malaria in children in October year two thousand and twenty one.", WHO website
"The vaccine reached more than two million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi
through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme from year two thousand and nineteen to year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website
"Independent evaluations of the pilot introductions of the RTS,S vaccine in these three countries
demonstrated high public health impact: a vaccine-attributable thirteen percent  drop in mortality among
children age-eligible for vaccination; substantial reduction in hospitalizations for severe
malaria; and, improved access to at least one malaria prevention intervention (malaria vaccine
or insecticide treated net), reaching more than ninety percent  of children.", WHO website
"The pilot programme was
completed at the end of year two thousand and twenty three and all countries are continuing their malaria vaccination
programmes.", WHO website
"Both malaria vaccines are safe and efficacious, and both have been prequalified by World Health Organization.", WHO website
"In phase three clinical trials both vaccines reduced malaria cases by more than half during the first
year after vaccination – the period when children are at high risk of illness and death.", WHO website
A fourth vaccine dose given in the second year of life prolonged protection., WHO website
"Both vaccines reduce
malaria cases by seventy percent  when given seasonally in areas of highly seasonal transmission where
seasonal malaria chemoprevention is provided.", WHO website
"Highest impact is achieved when a combination of World Health Organization-recommended preventive, diagnostic,
and treatment strategies are used, tailored by the country to the local context.", WHO website
Roll out of malaria vaccines is well underway., WHO website
"By early April year two thousand and twenty five, nineteen countries had introduced the vaccine sub-nationally as part of routine childhood vaccinations, with scale-up and additional roll-outs planned throughout the year.", WHO website
"Tens of thousands of young lives could be saved every year with
scale up of these malaria vaccines.", WHO website
"How do the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines compare?", WHO website
"Both the R21 and RTS,S vaccines are shown to be safe and effective in preventing malaria in
children and are expected to have high public health impact.", WHO website
"RTS,S has been shown in large pilot implementations to substantially reduce malaria illness
and deaths in young children.", WHO website
"Given the similarity of the two malaria vaccines, it is likely that
R21 will also be highly impactful.", WHO website
"Tens of thousands of young lives could be saved every year
with the wide implementation of these malaria vaccines.", WHO website
"The R21 and RTS,S malaria vaccines have not been tested in a head to head trial.", WHO website
Both have been shown to reduce malaria cases by more than half during the first year after vaccination –this is the period when children are at highest risk of malaria illness and death., WHO website
A fourth dose prolongs the protection., WHO website
"Both vaccines prevent around 75 percent  of malaria episodes when given
seasonally in areas of highly seasonal transmission where seasonal malaria chemoprevention
is provided.", WHO website
There is no evidence to date showing one vaccine performs better than the other., WHO website
"The choice of product to be used in a country should be based on programmatic characteristics,
vaccine supply and vaccine affordability.", WHO website
"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has established an
exceptional time limited co-financing policy for malaria vaccines, to increase affordability.", WHO website
Many Gavi-supported countries will pay as little as zero point two dollar per dose for either vaccine., WHO website
"Multiple modelling studies show cost-effectiveness of malaria vaccines according to standard
measures.", WHO website
"R21, which is currently less expensive than RTS,S, is estimated to have similar cost
effectiveness to other malaria control interventions, and both malaria vaccines are estimated to
be highly cost-effective when compared with other childhood vaccines.", WHO website
"Costing studies show
malaria vaccine introduction costs are similar to the costs of other new vaccines at introduction.", WHO website
"The RTS,S vaccine was prequalified by World Health Organization in July year two thousand and twenty two.", WHO website
"The R21 malaria vaccine was
prequalified by World Health Organization in December year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website
"World Health Organization prequalification ensures vaccine safety and
quality.", WHO website
What is the status of malaria vaccines roll-out?, WHO website
"Rollout of the RTS,S and R21 malaria vaccines is well underway.", WHO website
"By early April year two thousand and twenty five, nineteen
countries in Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte
d’Ivoire, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi,
Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda) were offering
malaria vaccines as part of their childhood immunization programmes, and according to their
national malaria control plans.", WHO website
"Additional countries are expected to introduce and scale up
either RTS,S or R21 malaria vaccines in year two thousand and twenty five.", WHO website
"The status of introduction can be found on the
malaria vaccine introduction dashboard.", WHO website
Demand for the malaria vaccines is unprecedented., WHO website
"At least 30 countries in Africa plan to
introduce the malaria vaccine into their childhood immunization programmes and as part of
their national malaria control strategies.", WHO website
"With two malaria vaccines recommended and available, vaccine supply is expected to be
sufficient to meet the high demand.", WHO website
"What does the World Health Organization recommendation for two malaria vaccines mean for children at risk
of malaria?", WHO website
"The availability of two safe and effective malaria vaccines, RTS,S and R21, results in sufficient
vaccine supply to meet demand and benefit children living in areas where malaria is a major
public health risk.", WHO website
"According to modelling estimates, malaria vaccines could prevent
approximately half a million child deaths by year two thousand and thirty five if they were scaled up in moderate and high
malaria transmission areas.", WHO website
What about the MVIP: will the malaria vaccine pilots continue?, WHO website
"The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi was
completed at the end of year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website
"All three countries continued provision of malaria vaccination
through the childhood immunization programme with Gavi support
The MVIP was designed to evaluate the public health use of the RTS,S vaccine in Ghana,
Kenya and Malawi.", WHO website
"Between year two thousand and nineteen and year two thousand and twenty three, more than two million children were reached with
the malaria vaccine across the three countries, and implementation resulted in a substantial drop in
mortality (thirteen percent ) among children age-eligible for the vaccine, as well as a reduction in
hospitalizations for severe malaria.", WHO website
"The success of the MVIP and lessons learned through the pilot programme informed R21
vaccine considerations and facilitated more efficient development of additional malaria
vaccines, including the World Health Organization recommendation for the second malaria vaccine, R21.", WHO website
"The MVIP was coordinated by World Health Organization and supported by in-country and international partners,
including Ministries of Health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, PATH, UNICEF and GSK.", WHO website
"Financing for the MVIP was provided by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid.", WHO website
"Malaria: Artemisinin partial resistance
Efficacious antimalarial medicines are critical to malaria control and elimination.", WHO website
"Continuous
monitoring of their efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic
countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.", WHO website
What is the artemisinin and how is it used for the treatment of malaria?, WHO website
"Isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, artemisinin and its derivatives
are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium
parasites in the blood of patients with malaria.", WHO website
"Artemisinin-based combination therapies Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are recommended by World Health Organization as the first- and
second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria as well as for chloroquine-
resistant P. vivax malaria.", WHO website
"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies combine an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin derivatives
include artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin) with a partner drug.", WHO website
"The role of the
artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first 3 days of treatment
(reduction of parasite biomass), while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining
parasites (cure).", WHO website
World Health Organization currently recommends six different Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies., WHO website
"Two injectable treatments, artesunate or
artemether, are recommended for the treatment of severe malaria and should be followed by an
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy when the patient can tolerate oral therapy.", WHO website
"Increased access to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies in malaria-endemic countries has been integral to the remarkable
success in reducing the global malaria burden over the last fifteen years.", WHO website
"Almost four billion, five hundred million treatment courses of prequalified Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies were delivered globally by manufacturers between
year two thousand and ten and year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website
"An estimated sixty eight percent  of these procurements were reported to have been
distributed to the public sector in malaria endemic countries.", WHO website
"Artesunate-amodiaquine; artesunate-mefloquine; artesunate-pyronaridine;
artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; artemether-lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine.", WHO website
What is the definition of “artemisinin partial resistance”?, WHO website
"Artemisinin partial resistance typically refers to a delay in the clearance of malaria parasites
from the bloodstream following treatment with an Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.", WHO website
"As a result, the artemisinin compound
is less effective in clearing all parasites within a 3-day period among patients who are infected
with artemisinin partial resistant strains of malaria.", WHO website
"Studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasites against
artemisinin compounds affect only one stage of the malaria parasite cycle in humans: the ring
stage.", WHO website
"It is therefore more appropriate to call the delayed clearance “partial resistance” to
highlight this time-limited and cycle-specific feature.", WHO website
"It is unknown whether artemisinin partial
resistance could further evolve to affect other stages of the parasites, developing into complete
resistance. “Full” artemisinin resistance has not been reported.", WHO website
"Currently, even if patients are infected with artemisinin partial resistant parasites, nearly all
patients treated with an Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy are fully cured provided that the partner drug is highly efficacious
in that geographical area.", WHO website
"In the absence of partner drug resistance, artemisinin partial
resistance rarely leads to treatment failure.", WHO website
"Furthermore, there is no evidence that artemisinin
partial resistance alone has resulted in an increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in the
areas where it has been detected.", WHO website
What are the current molecular markers of artemisinin partial resistance?, WHO website
"Artemisinin partial resistance is seen as delayed parasites clearance after treatment with a drug
containing artemisinin.", WHO website
"In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mutations in
the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 BTB/POZ and propeller domain (PfK13) are associated with this delayed
parasite clearance.", WHO website
"To date, more than 260 non-synonymous PfK13 mutations have been
reported.", WHO website
"However, not all the non-synonymous PfK13 mutants reported are associated with
artemisinin partial resistance; mutants can also represent genotypes arising de novo but not
being selected for.", WHO website
Different PfK13 mutations have varying effects on the clearance phenotype., WHO website
"World Health Organization has
established a list of candidates or associated and validated markers of artemisinin partial
resistance.", WHO website
What is the state of partial artemisinin resistance around the world?, WHO website
"Clear evidence of parasites partially resistant to artemisinin has now been identified in the
Greater Mekong subregion and Africa – specifically in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and
the United Republic of Tanzania.", WHO website
"In late year two thousand and thirteen, researchers identified a new molecular marker: mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13
propeller domain were shown to be associated with delayed parasite clearance in vitro and in
vivo following treatments with artemisinins.", WHO website
"The molecular marker allows for a more precise
mapping and monitoring of the geographical distribution of artemisinin partial resistance.", WHO website
"Artemisinin partial resistance likely first emerged in the Greater Mekong sub-region prior to year two thousand and one, and prior to the
widespread deployment of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies.", WHO website
"Molecular surveys have shown that artemisinin partial
resistance has emerged independently in several locations within the Greater Mekong sub-region.", WHO website
"In Africa, artemisinin partial resistance has been confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda,Uganda and the
United Republic of Tanzania.", WHO website
"These parasites have emerged independently and have not spread
from South-East Asia.", WHO website
"Based on available evidence, such resistance is also suspected in
Ethiopia, Namibia, Sudan and Zambia.", WHO website
What is the current state of ‘Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy’ failures around the world?, WHO website
The efficacy of World Health Organization-recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies is assessed through therapeutic efficacy studies., WHO website
"Such studies done at regular intervals at the same sites allow for the early detection of
declines in drug efficacy, providing evidence for guiding national malaria treatment policies.", WHO website
"While artemisinin partial resistance alone rarely leads to treatment failure, in the Greater
Mekong subregion there is also resistance to a number of the Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy partner drugs.", WHO website
"As a
consequence, several Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are failing in the Greater Mekong sub-region.", WHO website
"Managing the drug resistance situation
requires close monitoring but there are still Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies available, capable of treating patients even
in the areas where the drug resistance is worst.", WHO website
"In Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, where artemisinin partial
resistance has been confirmed, therapeutic efficacy studies are being done to ensure that the
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies which are recommended in the national treatment policy continue to be efficacious.", WHO website
"In
other areas of Africa, a few Therapeutic Efficacy Study studies have reported treatment failures from studies with
artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.", WHO website
"World Health Organization is working with countries
and partners to investigate if these failures are linked to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy partner drug resistance.", WHO website
"How is World Health Organization supporting countries in the ‘Greater Mekong’ sub-region tackle multi-drug
resistance?", WHO website
"In the Greater Mekong Subregion, the response to resistance has included improved
monitoring of efficacy and resistance and pursuit of malaria elimination.", WHO website
"In collaboration with national malaria programmes and partners, World Health Organization led the development of
the Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion (year two thousand and fifteen to  year two thousand and thirty).", WHO website
"With
technical guidance from World Health Organization, all Greater Mekong sub-region countries have developed national malaria elimination
plans that are aligned with the subregional strategy.", WHO website
"As countries implement these plans, World Health Organization
is providing ongoing technical support through its five Greater Mekong sub-region country offices, regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, and the Organization’s headquarters in Geneva.", WHO website
"Furthermore, in year two thousand and seventeen, World Health Organization launched the Mekong Malaria Elimination programme.", WHO website
"The MME subregional team in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, supports the malaria elimination
strategy by facilitating coordination and dialogue among partners, communicating with
external stakeholders, and coordinating cross-border initiatives.", WHO website
"Impressive progress has been
made towards eliminating P. falciparum from the Greater Mekong sub-region.", WHO website
How is World Health Organization responding to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa?, WHO website
"The emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa necessitates a response aiming to
ensure that efficacious treatments remain available.", WHO website
"An immediate priority is to provide support
to improve the phenotypic and genotypic surveillance to better map the extent of the resistance.", WHO website
"Plans are being developed to help countries address issues that could cause resistance to
spread.", WHO website
"Artemisinin partial resistance has likely occurred as a consequence of several factors: poor
treatment practices, inadequate patient adherence to prescribed antimalarial regimens, and the
widespread availability of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard forms of the drug.", WHO website
"Scaling up interventions will require considerable financial resources, long-term political
commitment, and strong cross-border cooperation.", WHO website
"One of the most urgent challenges is to
strengthen pharmaceutical market regulation and remove oral artemisinin-based monotherapies
and substandard medicines from markets.", WHO website
"In November year two thousand and twenty two, World Health Organization launch a new Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in
Africa.", WHO website
"The strategy aims to tackle drug resistance through, among other actions, tracking its
spread, identifying the populations most at risk, and developing viable alternative treatments.", WHO website
"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies remains the best available treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and it is
imperative that the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance does not lead health care
providers or patients to hesitate to prescribe and use Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies to treat confirmed malaria.", WHO website
Who is funding these efforts?, WHO website
"The fight to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong sub-region is supported through
generous contributions from a number of donors, including: the Australian Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund); the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development
Office of the UK Government; and the US Agency for International Development.", WHO website
"In response to the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in the Greater Mekong sub-region, the Global Fund
launched the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) in year two thousand and thirteen.", WHO website
"Funding provided
through this initiative has enabled countries to purchase and distribute commodities such as
long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic tests and quality-assured drugs.", WHO website
"In year two thousand and twenty, the Global Fund announced an expansion of the RAI (RAI3E), committing an additional two hundred and twenty eight point three million Dollars for the period year two thousand and twenty one to year two thousand and twenty three.", WHO website

"Given the heavy reliance on Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies in Africa, the threat of artemisinin partial resistance and
partner drug resistance must be monitored and addressed urgently.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The apparent rapid spread
of some mutations associated with artemisinin partial resistance means that vigorous measures
must be taken before Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies start failing in Africa.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"With no alternative drugs likely to
become available in the near future, it is essential to preserve the therapeutic lifespan of

artemisinin partial resistance and high partner drug resistance could result in sixteen million
additional malaria cases and three hundred and sixty thousand hospitalized severe cases.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

"Drivers of resistance
Understanding the factors that play a role in driving the emergence and spread of
resistance is critical to effectively respond to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"A
broad literature review and consultation process led to the identification of two categories
of factors driving resistance: background drivers and treatment-related drivers.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Background drivers include intrinsic factors linked to the parasite, host and drugs used, as
well as environmental factors.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Treatment-related drivers are those affecting how often, at
what dose, and for how long a parasite population is exposed to a given drug.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"This Strategy focuses primarily on identifying practical interventions to address
treatment- related drivers of resistance, while calling for increased research on background
drivers.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The risk of the emergence and spread of resistance increases when a high number
of parasites are exposed to drugs, when parasites are exposed to one drug only, when
parasites are exposed to subtherapeutic drug levels, when parasites that are not fully
sensitive are more likely to be transmitted, and when parasites are exposed to drugs to
which they are not fully sensitive.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Interventions to mitigate the risks and respond to the emergence and
spread of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa
The Strategy addresses the threat of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa through four
pillars.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Each pillar consists of a set of interventions (twenty in total) that can be implemented
at the local, regional and global levels.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"While this Strategy gives a comprehensive
overview of the gamut of interventions that can be implemented, implementing
countries need to tailor the Strategy to their local context.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"An initial country assessment is
needed to enable countries to focus on the factors that are most likely to drive the
emergence and spread of resistance in their context, and to prioritize their efforts in
responding to resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Pillar I: Strengthen surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance
Our ability to respond appropriately and in a timely manner to the spread of artemisinin
partial resistance and the potential emergence of resistance to partner medicines is hindered
by the lack of up-to-date information.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"However, these efforts are limited by many factors:
insufficient capacity, lack of funding, limited political commitment and will, non-
compliance with standards (or lack of standards) and protocols to ensure data of
comparable quality, lack of planning to ensure that data are available from the areas where
they are most needed, and sometimes years of delay between data collection and findings
being shared with relevant stakeholders.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"This pillar calls for strengthened surveillance
capacity, as well as increased technical and laboratory capacity to provide expanded
coverage of the data on antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance in Africa.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"It builds upon
the significant investments already made in regional networks and in- country
collaborations.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Pillar II: Optimize and better regulate the use of diagnostics and therapeutics to limit drug
pressure through pre-emptive measures
Protecting the efficacy of existing Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies is an immediate priority.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The suboptimal use of existing
diagnostics and therapeutics can increase drug pressure on the parasite population.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"From
a supply perspective, factors such as the inability to enforce stringent regulatory
standards, the lack of availability of a diversified portfolio of quality-assured drugs at
country level, and the circulation of substandard or falsified drugs and non-
recommended monotherapies
can increase drug pressure unnecessarily.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"From a demand perspective, the lack of demand
for alternative drugs to artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine, as well as
the inappropriate use of available antimalarial drugs and diagnostics due to provider or
patient behaviour could further contribute to the emergence and spread of antimalarial
drug
resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"This pillar calls for a more deliberate use of diagnostics and antimalarials to
reduce drug pressure, notably through better adherence to World Health Organization recommendations and
full use of the diversity of tools available in the set of antimalarial compounds.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"To ensure
the availability, affordability and quality of these tools, the global malaria community
should use its combined market-shaping power to achieve healthier malaria commodity
markets, while being mindful of the need to promote innovation, in support of African-
led efforts.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Pillar III: React to resistance by limiting the spread of antimalarial drug-resistant parasites
Efforts to limit the transmission of malaria will affect both resistant and sensitive
parasites.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"However, to limit the risk of resistant parasites being selected and spreading,
the focus should be on prioritizing optimal vector control and other preventive measures,
such as chemoprevention and vaccines, in priority areas; restricting transmission from
recrudescent cases; and limiting any advantage that higher gametocyte carriage could
potentially confer to resistant parasites.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Although the risk in different areas and groups
should be assessed and is likely to differ by population, country and region, additional
resources and efforts should be
mobilized towards areas where resistance is confirmed, border areas where there is evidence
of resistance in neighbouring areas, and towards areas with significant inflows of mobile
and migrant populations from areas with known resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Underserved areas and hard-to-
reach populations (e.g. displaced populations, migrant populations, forest goers) should not
be omitted.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Lastly, promoting collaboration across borders could ensure that resistance
detected in one country is addressed through a regional response.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Pillar IV: Stimulate research and innovation to better leverage existing tools and develop new
tools against resistance
An effective response to the threat, limiting the potential impact of antimalarial drug
resistance, relies on a robust and sustainable pipeline of both therapeutic and non-
therapeutic tools.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"According to World Health Organization's latest World malaria report, funding for malaria-related
research and development reached just over six hundred and nineteen million in year two thousand and twenty.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

 year two thousand and thirty, it is estimated that an average annual investment of eight hundred and fifty one million dollars in research
and development is needed.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

current tools, for the development of new tools, and for increased modelling and
research to characterize resistance, its impact, drivers and how corrective interventions
might address those drivers.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

threat across all malaria-endemic countries, and that the interventions outlined in this
document could be applied to other geographies, although they would have to be tailored to
local specificities.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The Strategy has three objectives that are instrumental to achieving the goal:
- Improve the detection of resistance to ensure a timely response.
- Delay the emergence of resistance to artemisinin and artemisinin-based
combination therapy partner drugs.
- Limit the selection and spread of resistant parasites where resistance has been confirmed.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"To achieve these strategic objectives, factors driving the emergence and spread of resistance
have been identified.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Addressing these drivers will have a direct impact on antimalarial
drug resistance and improve the overall quality of care.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

(2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In addition,
there is a vast number of asymptomatic malaria cases; these cases contribute greatly to the
continuing transmission of malaria parasites and can have a negative health impact on
those infected.
Africa bears almost the entire burden of malaria.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In year two thousand and twenty, ninety six percent of global malaria cases
(two hundred and thirty two+B311 million) were estimated to have occurred in Africa.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

P. falciparum.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Once infected, some population groups are more vulnerable to severe disease
and death, as they have relatively little immunity against the disease.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"These groups include
children under five years of age, pregnant women, people living with HIV/AIDS and populations
with low immunity moving to areas with high transmission, such as travellers, migrant workers

"Even
before the emergence of the coronavirus disease pandemic, global gains
against malaria had levelled off, and the world was not on track to reach the year two thousand and twenty
milestones of the Global technical strategy for malaria year two thousand and sixteen to  year two thousand and thirty (Global technical strategy for malaria) (1).",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"During the
Coronavirus disease pandemic, the situation worsened as many countries experienced disruptions to
malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Mainly because of these disruptions to services,
the incidence of malaria increased in year two thousand and twenty.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In addition, progress has been made difficult by
new threats in Africa, such as the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance; spread of
parasites that go undetected by the most widely used rapid diagnostic tests due to P.

2 and 3 (Pfhrp2/3) gene deletions; vector resistance to insecticides; and reports from an
increasing number of African countries of invasion by Anopheles stephensi, an urban malaria
vector originally confined to Asia.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Despite these threats, the funding gap between the amount
invested and the resources needed has widened dramatically in recent years, increasing from two billion, three million
dollars in year two thousand and eighteen to two billion, six hundred million dollars in year two thousand and nineteen and three billion, five hundred million dollars in year two thousand and twenty.",World Health Organization.

"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies at the heart of the response
There has been widespread antimalarial drug resistance in Africa in the past.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In year two thousand and one,
World Health Organization recommended the use of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies in countries where P. falciparum malaria was
resistant to previously efficacious treatments, such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine and, to a lesser extent, amodiaquine.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
An Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy consists of a combination of an artemisinin derivative and a partner drug.,World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies
are recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The role
of the artemisinin derivative is to rapidly reduce the parasite biomass, while the role of
the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites after artemisinin has been
cleared from the blood.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Even if used as a monotherapy, in the absence of resistance, a full
dose of any partner drug included in the six World Health Organization-recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies - artemether-
lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate-
mefloquine, artesunate+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate-pyronaridine - can
clear parasitaemia and cure patients.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

derivative, the partner drug Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies as a monotherapy starting shortly after the
administration of the last dose of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Consequently, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies differ from most other
combination therapies, in that they include drugs with very different pharmacokinetics;
accordingly, they could be characterized as artemisinin- boosted antimalarials.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"While World Health Organization currently recommends six Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies, the majority of patients are treated with
either artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemether-lumefantrine is
the most widely used treatment course, representing over eighty five percent of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies procured
by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, followed by
artesunate-amodiaquine representing ten percent.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
Several factors explain this pre-eminence.,World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemether-lumefantrine was the first Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy to be developed, and it is the first-line therapy in most African countries.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-
amodiaquine are the most affordable options,
at zero point six dollar and zero point seven eight dollar per adult treatment course, respectively, versus two to three dollar for
other Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemether-lumefantrine is also the most accessible Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy, with prequalified
artemether-lumefantrine being produced by nine suppliers with significant production
capacity.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Defining and monitoring resistance
There are two main working definitions of resistance:
- Antimalarial drug resistance is defined as the ability of a parasite strain to survive and/
or multiply despite the administration and absorption of a drug given in doses equal to
or higher than those usually recommended, but within tolerance of the subject.
- Artemisinin partial resistance can be defined as delayed clearance after treatment with a
drug containing an artemisinin derivative of a parasite strain carrying a particular
mutation or set of mutations that are validated as associated with this delayed
clearance, despite the administration and absorption of the drug given in doses equal
to or higher than those usually recommended, but within tolerance of the subject.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Significant reduction of treatment efficacy has not been observed in association with
changes in P. falciparum sensitivity to artemisinin derivatives.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"So far, artemisinin partial
resistance appears to only affect the P. falciparum ring stage, leading to delayed clearance
of parasitaemia.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Consequently, after three days of treatment, a larger biomass remains,
which must be eliminated by the partner drug.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"This delayed clearance has been found to
be associated with P. falciparum Kelch13 mutations.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"However, even in areas
of high prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 mutations, a seven-day artesunate treatment has shown
over 90 percent efficacy, suggesting that delayed clearance does not meet the standard
definition of antimalarial drug resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The observed delayed clearance is, therefore,
termed
artemisinin partial resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"There is no evidence that changes in sensitivity
to artemisinin derivatives affect any asexual stage other than the ring stage and no
evidence of artemisinin full resistance, i.e. leading to treatment failure following a full
dose of artesunate.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"There are indications that Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 mutations could facilitate the spread of artemisinin
partial resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In the Greater Mekong subregion, some strains carrying
Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 mutations associated with partial resistance appear to have an increased
capability to generate gametocyte carriage.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"This has not been confirmed in Africa;
however, the increases in the proportion of parasites carrying Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 mutations now
observed in some countries in Africa indicate that parasites with this mutation have an
advantage under current treatment strategies and transmission dynamics; this could be due
to higher transmissibility or improved fitness.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In areas with artemisinin partial resistance, delayed clearance after treatment with an Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy
does not necessarily lead to an increase in treatment failure rates in the absence of partner
drug resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"However, partner drug resistance can cause treatment failure.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"In the Greater Mekong sub-region,
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies have remained efficacious despite the presence of artemisinin partial resistance,
provided that there is no resistance to partner drugs.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Artemisinin partial resistance puts
partner drugs at greater risk by exposing an increased number of parasites to the partner
drug alone.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

resistance to the Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy partner drug piperaquine across countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Although not
confirmed to date, there is also a concern over the potential loss of efficacy of artesunate

"Therapeutic efficacy studies remain the gold
standard for determining antimalarial drug efficacy.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

"To be comparable across countries and over time, it is crucial to
use standardized protocols.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Therapeutic Efficacy Studys alone are not sufficient to confirm drug resistance; this
must be confirmed through other means:
- Molecular marker analyses (genotypes) identify genetic changes in the parasite genome
that are associated with a change in parasite susceptibility to antimalarial drugs.
- Ex vivo and in vitro assays (phenotypes) test the sensitivity of fresh or culture-adapted
parasites to antimalarial drugs by exposing them to different concentrations of a
drug (typically for forty two hours) or to a pulse of a high concentration of a drug (in
ring-stage survival assay) and observing the effect on parasite survival.
- Measurements of drug levels in the blood allow monitoring of the concentration of drug
that malaria parasites are exposed to and can help to distinguish whether a treatment
failure is due to insufficient antimalarial drug exposure or due to resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The threat of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa
Antimalarial drug resistance in Africa: Artemisinin partial resistance in Africa
Evidence of the selection and spread of parasites with partial resistance to
artemisinin derivatives has been documented in the following areas of Africa;
- Rwanda: Two studies conducted by the national malaria programme

Concerns were raised about the quality of microscopy in Burkina Faso.,World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Analysis
using a Bayesian algorithm (as for the studies in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Uganda) is not recommended by World Health Organization for reporting treatment outcomes and can, in high
transmission settings, yield higher
treatment failure rates than the year two thousand and eight World Health Organization standard polymerase chain reaction

- Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine: Except for the studies in Burkina Faso

dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were systematically associated with treatment
failures with artemether-lumefantrine (see above), high treatment failure rates after

- During a Therapeutic Efficacy Study, many confounders may potentially obscure measures of artemether-
lumefantrine treatment failure: poor drug absorption, non-adherence (as the second
daily dose is often unsupervised), and the short half-life of lumefantrine leading to
high reinfection rates, with some reinfections potentially misclassified as recrudescence

Effectively responding to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance requires an
understanding of the factors that play a role in driving the emergence and spread of
resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The emergence of drug-resistant parasites happens in two stages: first, the
initial random genetic event that makes a parasite less sensitive to a drug, and second, the
survival, selection and subsequent spread of parasites carrying one or more mutations that
provide some degree of protection from the effect of a drug.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The role the different factors play in driving the emergence, selection and spread of
resistance will vary by drug and context.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"There is good consensus on the factors that may
drive the emergence and spread of resistance, but knowledge of their relative importance is
limited by the lack of available data and evidence.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"A broad literature review and consultation process led to the identification of two
categories of factors driving resistance: background drivers and treatment-related drivers
Background drivers include intrinsic factors linked to the parasite, host and drugs used, as
well as environmental factors.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Background drivers of resistance
Parasite genetic background can influence the degree to which a mutation affects drug
sensitivity and the likelihood that the mutation will spread.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Certain genetic backgrounds or
additional mutations can improve resistant parasites' ability to compete with other parasites,
even in the absence of drug pressure.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Consequently, the effect and potential for spread of a
mutation can differ between P. falciparum parasite strains from Africa and those from other
malaria-endemic regions.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
The level of transmission could impact the risk of spread.,World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Higher malaria transmission
results in many strains circulating in a population and a higher chance of mixing genetic
material during a parasite's sexual reproduction.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Therefore, higher malaria transmission
increases the risk that some potential background resistance mutations will be lost and
increases the competition with other parasite strains.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Additionally, populations living in
higher transmission areas have some level of acquired immunity, meaning that the host is
better able to eliminate parasites regardless of the level of drug resistance.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
A range of additional setting-specific factors affect the emergence and spread of resistance.,World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"These factors include human migration from areas with resistance, the ability of local
mosquitoes to spread the resistant strain, and climate change, which alters temperature, humidity
and rainfall, potentially shifting the geography and seasonality of transmission.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Malaria parasites are
exposed to different antimalarial drugs that are intended to cure patients by eliminating

"Possible consequences include:
- an increase in transmission due to artemisinin partial resistance if artemisinin partial
resistance is shown to increase gametocyte carriage;
- an increase in transmission due to recrudescence caused by partner drug resistance;
- an increase in morbidity and mortality; although this has not been observed in the Greater Mekong sub-region, it could
be a consequence of increased transmission in Africa;
- underlying economic costs due to both the repeated care required to treat patients infected
by resistant parasites and the productivity losses resulting from the increased morbidity (e.g.
absenteeism in the workplace due to disease burden or the need to care for a sick child, loss of
school days) and mortality (i.e. years of productive life lost due to premature death);
- a need to rapidly rotate to another Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy  if there is evidence of partner drug failure, with
operational implications such as policy changes, training requirements and review of supply
chains, as well as a potential incremental cost linked to the new commodity;
- a specific risk borne by lumefantrine, as artemether-lumefantrine is the most widely used
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy  in Africa to date; resistance to lumefantrine would also represent a major set- back in
recent research and development efforts, as the most promising non-artemisinin combination -

lumefantrine;
- a risk that TArtemisinin-based Combination Therapies based on the currently available drugs (artemether-lumefantrine-
amodiaquine) may no longer be an option should artemisinin partial resistance spread further

spreading is high.
- Population groups with limited or no access to regular health services and groups with
increased risk of malaria: These can include migrants and mobile populations
(internal or international), refugees, military personnel, and populations in conflict
areas.
- Vulnerable populations with relatively little immunity against the disease: These groups
include children under 5, pregnant women, people living with HIV/AIDS and
populations with low immunity moving to areas with high transmission.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

policies that differ from those promoted by the ministry of health.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"The policy and
impact of this need to be assessed.
- Supply chain: Map out in-country supply chains, including the main distribution
channels and storage; assess stockouts in the public sector as a priority (frequency
and root causes).
- Quality of drugs throughout the supply chain: Review available data on the quality of
drugs throughout the supply chain, key potential factors of drug degradation (e.g.
heat in facilities), and the systems in place to monitor this.
- Diagnostics availability, use and quality:

research and assessment could be targeted at the most context-relevant background
drivers, especially environmental ones.",World Health Organization. (2022). Strategy to respond to antimalarial drug resistance in Africa. 
"Understand the current behavioural drivers of care provider and patient choices.
- Care providers: Review information on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of care
providers (by provider type as available):
- Practices: This should include patterns of diagnosis, prescription and
communication to patients, including the role of traditional healers.
- Felt needs and preferences: This should include the preference for prescribing
certain types and dosages of treatment, perceived benefits of parasitological
diagnosis and malaria treatments, and perceived value in spending time to ensure
that patients understand the importance of taking the full treatment.
- Barriers and incentives that could affect the effectiveness of interventions:
This should include barriers to treating patients as per the national treatment
guidelines (e.g. availability of drugs), as well as incentives for providing
non- recommended treatments (e.g. financial).
- Patients: Review information on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of patients.
- Practices: This should include when and where treatment is sought, compliance to
prescribed treatment and use of vector control interventions.
- Knowledge and understanding: This should include knowledge of symptoms,
prevention, and the need for parasitological diagnosis and completion of the
seventy two B978correct treatment.
- Communication: This should include the main sources of information on
malaria prevention and treatment, and key challenges in communication (e.g.

"Strengths and weaknesses of the health and regulatory systems: Assess the strengths of the health and
regulatory systems.
- Health care funding mix: Examples include the mix between donor-provided funds,
domestic public funding, private health insurance and out-of-pocket payments.
- Structure of care provision: This includes assessment of the role and importance of the
different sectors of care (e.g. public, private formal and informal sectors).
- Integrated delivery of care: Examples include the B982level of integration of care delivered
throughout the patient journey (e.g. referral to inpatient care) and across different
diseases (e.g. integrated community case management).
- Quality of care: Examples include indicators measuring coverage (e.g. universal
health coverage index), infrastructure (e.g. number of operating rooms) and health
outcomes (e.g. neonatal mortality).
- Human resources: Examples include the availability of resources (e.g. number of
nurses per one thousand people), distribution of Health Care Workers across the country and their level of
training.
- Health information systems and monitoring: Examples include assessment of the
systems and processes in place to monitor, analyse and evaluate ongoing
programmes.
- Procurement and supply management systems: Examples include planning and
projecting a country's health resource needs, the availability of pharmaceuticals and
supply of products to the facilities.

Vaccines are biological substances that provide immunity/protection against specific diseases by stimulating the bodys immune system to recognize and kill the pathogen causing the disease.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"The malaria vaccines act against Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Despite the availability of preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medications, the malaria vaccine represents a crucial advancement in the fight
against this disease, particularly in high-burden areas.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Independent evaluations of the pilot introductions of the RTS S vaccine demonstrated a significant public health impact, including a vaccine- attributable thirteen percent drop in mortality among eligible children, a substantial reduction in
hospitalizations for severe malaria, and over ninety percent of children having access to at least one malaria prevention intervention, whether through the vaccine or ITNs.",FEDGEN-PHIS
The  World Health Organisation recommended that malaria vaccines be provided to children in four doses from around five months of age.,FEDGEN-PHIS
Vaccination programs may give the first dose at a later or slightly earlier age based on operational considerations.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"The development of malaria vaccines, such as the RTS and S/AS01 (Mosquirix), represents a significant advancement in preventive measures, aiming to reduce the incidence of malaria, especially in high-burden regions.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Africa's capacity to prevent and manage infectious illnesses is influenced by vaccine sustainability and safety, which are essential aspects of public health on the continent.",FEDGEN-PHIS
The recent introduction of malaria vaccines in Africa represents a significant milestone in the fight against malaria.,FEDGEN-PHIS

"Collaborations between governments, international organizations, and vaccine producers are crucial to meeting this need.",FEDGEN-PHIS
A one billion dollars project called the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator was introduced in year two thousand and twenty four to increase the continent's capacity to produce vaccines.,FEDGEN-PHIS
This program aims to reduce disparities in vaccine access and strengthen pandemic preparedness by increasing Africa's vaccine production from two percent to sixty percent by year two thousand and forty.,FEDGEN-PHIS
Key factors influencing the long-term safety and efficacy of malaria vaccines are;,FEDGEN-PHIS
"The duration of immunity, the range of immune responses, and the difficulties of implementing malaria vaccines in endemic areas are major aspects that affect their long-term safety and effectiveness.",FEDGEN-PHIS
Vaccines that can retain high levels of security over longer periods are necessary for long-term efficacy and sustained malaria control.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"Effective vaccines must target multiple antigens to protect against different species of Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"However, genetic differences in these antigens need to be considered.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"These differences can vary among Plasmodium strains, which may make vaccines less effective if they only target a few antigens.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"For a malaria vaccine to work well, it must consider these genetic differences to protect against many types of Plasmodium and provide lasting immunity.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"The immune response of the RTS,S/AS01E, which triggers CD4+ T cell responses and anti-CS protein antibodies, ought to comprise both humoral and cellular elements.",FEDGEN-PHIS
This is driving innovation of next-generation vaccine development to increase the robustness and range of immune responses.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"Community perception and acceptance rate of malaria vaccines in Africa Perception plays a crucial role in the adoption of malaria treatments in Africa, as cultural beliefs, misinformation, and trust in healthcare systems can significantly affect individuals' willingness to seek and follow medical advice.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Negative perceptions or misunderstandings about specific treatments can hinder acceptance, even when these interventions are scientifically proven effective.",FEDGEN-PHIS
A review study published in March this year highlighted the varied perceptions of malaria vaccines across different African communities.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"In countries like Tanzania, only eleven percent of people were aware of the malaria vaccine, while in Nigeria, awareness was considerably higher at sixty percent.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Despite this difference in awareness, many individuals were still willing to take the vaccine if it became available.",FEDGEN-PHIS
Acceptance rates ranged from thirty two point three percent in Ethiopia to ninety six percent in Sierra Leone.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"However, challenges such as vaccine availability, distribution issues, and misunderstandings about the vaccine's effectiveness were also identified.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"In another recent review of eleven studies involving fourteen thousand, six hundred and sixty six participants, the acceptance rate of the malaria vaccine among caregivers was examined.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"The study found that more than ninety percent of people, including mothers, were willing to accept the vaccine.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Nigeria had the highest acceptance rate at ninety seven point six percent, followed by Ghana at ninety four point six percent and Tanzania at ninety two point five percent.",FEDGEN-PHIS
The study also found that mothers from the Igbo and other tribes were less likely to accept the vaccine.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"To increase acceptance, the study suggested the need for targeted interventions that consider cultural values and beliefs.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"In Nigeria, a study conducted in Enugu state by Chinawa et al. (year two thousand and twenty four) found that seventy two point one percent of respondents were aware of the malaria vaccine, witheighty three point one percent expressing a willingness to receive it.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Among mothers, ninety two point nine percent were willing to vaccinate their babies, while eighty one point one percent were open to vaccinating themselves and their children.",FEDGEN-PHIS
"Interestingly, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds were five times less likely to vaccinate themselves and their children compared to those from higher socio-economic groups.",FEDGEN-PHIS
These findings highlight the importance of community perception in accepting malaria vaccines across Africa.,FEDGEN-PHIS
"While many people are willing to take the vaccine, factors such as awareness, cultural beliefs, socio-economic status, and trust in healthcare systems play key roles in influencing vaccine uptake.",FEDGEN-PHIS

"Over the years, the Federal Government has put several interventions in place to control the scourge of the disease, one of which is the improvement of malaria case management at all levels.",FMOH
A major threat to these efforts however was the emergence of resistance to available antimalarial medicines such as chloroquine and Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine.,FMOH
The Drug Therapeutic Efficacy Tests on chloroquine and Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine in the six epidemiological zones in year two thousand and two evidently showed the inability of these medicines to completely clear malaria parasites in the blood.,FMOH
"The introduction in year two thousand and five, of Artemisinin based Combination Therapy Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies as treatment of uncomplicated malaria following the failure of chloroquine and Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine revolutionalized the treatment of malaria in the country.",FMOH
Presently Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are the most efficacious antimalarial treatment available globally.,FMOH
"In a renewed effort to control, the disease, emphasis has shifted from the vulnerable groups to the entire population at risk.",FMOH
"In this case, colour coded and pre-packaged antimalarial medicines will now be deployed to the public sector and also at highly reduced cost to the private sector.",FMOH
"By so doing, the medicines will be made available and affordable to the general populace.",FMOH

Malaria with coma persisting for greater than  thirty minute after a seizure is considered to be cerebral malaria.,FMOH
Cure: Elimination of the symptoms and asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite that caused the patient or caregiver to seek treatment.,FMOH
Resistance to antimalarials arises because of the selection of parasites with genetic mutations or gene amplifications that confer reduced susceptibility.,FMOH
Gametocytes: Sexual stages of malaria parasites present in the host red blood cells.,FMOH
A dark brown granular pigment formed by malaria parasites as a by-product of haemoglobin catabolism.,FMOH

Recurrence: The recurrence of asexual parasitaemia following treatment.,FMOH
"This can be caused by a recrudescence, a relapse (in P. vivax and P. ovale infections only) or a new infection.",FMOH
Recrudescence: The recurrence of asexual parasitaemia after treatment of the infection with the same infection that caused the original illness.,FMOH
This results from incomplete clearance of parasitaemia due to inadequate or ineffective treatment.,FMOH
"It is, therefore, different to a relapse in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and it differs from a new infection or re-infection (as identified by molecular genotyping in endemic areas).",FMOH
Relapse: The recurrence of asexual parasitaemia in P. vivax and P. ovale malaria deriving from persisting liver stages.,FMOH
Relapse occurs when the blood stage infection has been eliminated but hypnozoites persist in the liver and mature to form hepatic schizonts.,FMOH
"After variable intervals of weeks to months, the hepatic schizonts burst and liberate merozoites into the bloodstream.",FMOH
Severe anaemia: Haemoglobin concentration of less than 5 gram per one hundred millilitre (haematocrit less than  fifteen percent).,FMOH
Severe falciparum malaria: Acute falciparum malaria with signs of severity and/or evidence of vital organ dysfunction.,FMOH

Treatment solely on the basis of clinical suspicion should only be considered when a parasitological diagnosis is not accessible.,FMOH
Artemisinin-based combination therapies Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are the recommended treatments for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.,FMOH
Severe malaria is a medical emergency.,FMOH
"After rapid clinical assessment and confirmation of diagnosis where feasible, commence immediate treatment with parenteral medication.",FMOH
Intravenous artesunate is preferred for the treatment of severe P.falciparum malaria Parenteral quinine or artemether is an acceptable alternative if artesunate is not available.,FMOH
"Parenteral antimalarial medicines in the treatment of severe malaria should be administered for a minimum of twenty four hours once started (irrespective of the patients ability to tolerate oral medication earlier) and thereafter, complete treatment with a complete course of an Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.",FMOH
"In settings where complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, patients should be given pre-referral treatment and referred immediately to an appropriate facility for further treatment.",FMOH
"The recommended pre-referral treatment options include any of these; artesunate IM or rectal, and quinine IM.",FMOH
The recommended chemoprophylaxis for non immune visitors will be as available in the visitors country of origin or as recommended in Nigeria.,FMOH
Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine is the recommended medicine for Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy.,FMOH
Malaria remain a major public health problem in Nigeria;  children under the age of five and pregnant women are still the most affected.,FMOH
More than sixty percent outpatient visits in Nigeria are due to malaria.,FMOH
The disease has impacted negatively on the economy with about one hundred and thirty two billion Naira lost to the disease as cost of treatment and loss in man-hours.,FMOH
The launching of the Roll Back Malaria initiative in April twenty five year two thousand and the commitment of all African leaders to fight the disease which kills over one million children and pregnant women every year was commendable.,FMOH
One of the key strategies to control malaria is effective case management.,FMOH
"Unfortunately, this has received a major setback in the past years because of the high level of resistance to the first and second line antimalarial medicines; Chloroquine and Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine.",FMOH
"In year two thousand and five, the National Malaria Treatment Policy was reviewed during which the Artemisinin based Combination Therapies were introduced.",FMOH
These medicines are presently the most efficacious antimalarial treatment available.,FMOH
The therapeutic efficacy study in year two thousand and four and a repeat test in year two thousand and nine has continuously demonstrated high efficacy of these artemisinin combinations.,FMOH
"In addition, the Federal Ministry of Health is aware of the development of new potent combinations that are also highly effective and may deploy some of these as pilots in selected sites.",FMOH
"Until recently, in areas of high malaria transmission such as Nigeria, malaria treatment has been based mainly on clinical diagnosis which was presumptive, because malaria was considered one of the commonest causes of fever.",FMOH
"With the availability of new tools such as parasite-based rapid diagnostic kits, which compliments the standard microscopy, it is imperative to provide targeted treatment and, accurate estimation of true malaria cases.",FMOH
"However, in cases where parasitological confirmation is not available, highly vulnerable groups (including children under five years and those suspected with severe malaria) can be treated on a clinical basis.",FMOH
This guideline has been produced to provide information on the use of some antimalarial medicines approved for use in Nigeria to reflect the changes that have been incorporated into the reviewed National Antimalarial Treatment Policy.,FMOH
These are trained to recognize basic symptoms of uncomplicated malaria and treat them.,FMOH
"Management of malaria at health facilities occur at three levels: Level I: This includes such facilities as the Primary Health Care Clinics, Dispensaries and Health posts and is expected to be available in all the political wards and communities in the country.",FMOH
"The cadre of staff found in this level include Nurses, Community Health Officers, Community Health Extension Workers, Pharmacy technicians etc.",FMOH
These are trained to provide comprehensive management for uncomplicated malaria and also initiate appropriate treatment before referring suspected cases of severe malaria to higher facilities.,FMOH
"Occasionally, there may be medical officers and pharmacists and trained microscopist at this level of health care delivery.",FMOH
The main form of diagnosis is the use of Rapid Diagnostic Test kits.,FMOH
"Level II: This level consists of Comprehensive health centres, Cottage hospitals, General hospitals and some private hospitals.",FMOH
"At this level, there is capacity to carry out microscopy and other basic laboratory services and also to treat severe malaria in addition to providing in-patient care.",FMOH
Each LGA is expected to have at least one of these.,FMOH
"The cadre of staff found at this level are medical officers, pharmacists, medical laboratory scientists, nurses, Community Health Officers etc.",FMOH
Parasite based confirmation with microscopy shall be used to confirm suspected cases of malaria,FMOH
Level III: This represents the highest level of medical care in the country.,FMOH
"The facilities include Teachinghospitals, Specialist hospitals, Federal Medical centres.",FMOH
Some General and private hospitals belong to this category.,FMOH
"At least, one of these categories is found in each state of the Federation and provide specialized health care services.",FMOH
The cadres of health workers found here include specialists in various health disciplines.,FMOH
Parasite based confirmation with microscopy shall be used to confirm all cases with febrile illnesses,FMOH
"Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the parasite of the genus Plasmodium, transmitted mostly by the bite of an infected female anopheles mosquito.",FMOH
"In Nigeria, the species most responsible for the severe form of the disease that leads to death is P. falciparum.",FMOH
P. vivax does not occur in indigenous Nigerians.,FMOH
Malaria transmission is stable in Nigeria.,FMOH
"Children under the age of five, pregnant women and non-immune visitors from non-endemic areas are particularly more susceptible than the general population.",FMOH
"Based on clinical and laboratory profiles, malaria can be classified as uncomplicated or severe.",FMOH
Patients with malaria can die when the disease is not appropriately classified.,FMOH
Failure to recognize severe malaria may be fatal.,FMOH
a. Uncomplicated malaria: This is symptomatic malaria that has no vital organ dysfunction or life threatening manifestations.,FMOH
Severe malaria: This is when there is P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia and no other confirmed cause of their symptoms with the presence of life threatening clinical or laboratory features.,FMOH
"A complete history should include:  General information such as age, place of residence and recent history of travel within or outside the country.",FMOH
Malaria can be diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory evaluations.,FMOH
The signs and symptoms of malaria are non-specific.,FMOH
"However, clinical suspicion is based on fever or history of fever in the last twenty four hours and/or the presence of anaemia.",FMOH
"It is important to note that clinical diagnosis alone may result in over-diagnosis of malaria; hence, parasitological confirmation is strongly recommended.",FMOH
Clinical signs may include amongst other symptoms: Raised body temperature thirty seven point five degree celcius.,FMOH
"Enlarged spleen or liver, especially in children.",FMOH
Pallor (children/pregnant women) Exclude signs of severe disease.,FMOH
The changing epidemiology of malaria due to scale up of interventions and the introduction of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies have increased the urgency of improving the specificity of malaria diagnosis.,FMOH
Deployment of microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Tests must be accompanied by quality assurance.,FMOH
Antimalarial treatment should be limited to test positive cases.,FMOH
The negative cases should be reassessed for other common causes of fever.,FMOH
The benefit of parasitological diagnosis depends entirely on health-care providers adhering to the results in managing the patient.,FMOH
"However, the severity of the disease justifies the use of antimalarial medicines in test negative cases, considering the possible small risk of false negative tests.",FMOH
Parasitological confirmation is recommended in all suspected cases of malaria.,FMOH
"However, in areas of high transmission such as Nigeria, children under five years can still be treated on clinical basis where parasitological confirmation is not feasible.",FMOH
This is also applicable in cases of suspected severe malaria.,FMOH
Prompt and accurate diagnosis is part of effective disease management.,FMOH
High sensitivity of malaria diagnosis is important to identify those positive cases in all settings.,FMOH
"High specificity is vital to identify negative cases, which can reduce unnecessary treatment with antimalarial medicines and improve differential diagnosis of febrile illness.",FMOH
The results of parasitological diagnosis should be available within a short time (less than two hours) of the patient presenting.,FMOH
Microscopy is the standard method for parasitological diagnosis of malaria.,FMOH
This is done by examining a stained thick or thin blood smear for the presence of malaria parasites.,FMOH
Thick films are recommended for parasite detection and quantification and can be used to monitor response to treatment.,FMOH
Thin films are recommended for species identification.,FMOH
Microscopic examination of stained blood films by a highly skilled microscopist has a sensitivity range of eighty six to ninety eigh percent with a lower sensitivity in detecting low parasitaemias (three hundred and twenty per litre).,FMOH
Various factors such as the stage of the malaria infection and previous medication may reduce parasitaemia below the detectable threshold and necessitate repeat examination.,FMOH
Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests is a device which detects specific antigens (proteins) produced by malaria parasites.,FMOH
The Rapid Diagnostic Test signifies presence of the antigens by colour change on nitrocellulose strip (test strip) They provide a useful guide to the presence of clinically significant malaria infection.,FMOH
They complement microscopy based diagnosis where such services are not available.,FMOH
"However, Rapid Diagnostic Tests should not replace microscopy as the sole means of malaria diagnosis.",FMOH
The general management of a malaria patient should base treatment decisions not only on results but also other clinical parameters.,FMOH
"In case of uncomplicated malaria, the rationale of treatment for a MP slide/Rapid Diagnostic Test negative should be clearly defined by the managing clinician.",FMOH
Like all laboratory procedures the accuracy of an MP slide /Rapid Diagnostic Test is dependent on the care and expertise with which it is prepared and interpreted.,FMOH
Quality assured Histidine Rich Protein two based Rapid Diagnostic Test is the recommended for the diagnosis of malaria in all age groups.,FMOH
Most Rapid Diagnostic Tests have a sensitivity of ninety five percent at parasite densities of two hundred per litre of blood.,FMOH
"The choice between Rapid Diagnostic Tests and microscopy depends on local circumstances, including the skills available, patient case-load, epidemiology of malaria and the possible use of microscopy for the diagnosis of other diseases.",FMOH
"Where the case-load of fever patients is high, microscopy is likely to be less expensive than Rapid Diagnostic Tests, but may be less operationally feasible.",FMOH
"Microscopy has further advantages in that it can be used for speciation and quantification of parasites, and to assess response to antimalarial treatment.",FMOH
Microscopy can also be used in the identification of other causes of fever.,FMOH
"However, a major drawback of light microscopy is its requirement for well- trained, skilled staff and, usually, an energy source to power the microscope.",FMOH
"In many areas, malaria patients are treated outside of the formal health services, e.g.",FMOH
"in the community, in the home or by private providers; microscopy is generally not feasible in many such circumstances, but Rapid Diagnostic Tests may be possible.",FMOH
"Although Rapid Diagnostic Tests for detection of parasite antigen are generally more expensive, their deployment may be considerably cost effective in many of these settings.",FMOH
"The sensitivities and specificities of Rapid Diagnostic Tests are variable, and their vulnerability to high temperatures and humidity is an important constraint.",FMOH
"Despite these concerns, Rapid Diagnostic Tests make it possible to expand the use of confirmatory diagnosis In the diagnosis of severe malaria cases, microscopy is a preferred option; it not only provides the diagnosis of malaria, but it is useful in assessing other important parameters in a severely ill patient.",FMOH
"In situations where an Rapid Diagnostic Test has been used to confirm malaria, this allows for a rapid institution of antimalarial treatment, however, where possible a microscopic examination is recommended to enhance the overall management of the patient.",FMOH
Prompt parasitological confirmation by microscopy or Rapid Diagnostic Test is recommended in all patients suspected of Malaria before treatment is initiated.,FMOH
Prompt treatment will prevent both progressions to severe disease and the additional morbidity associated with treatment failure.,FMOH
Cure of the infection means eradication from the body of the parasite that caused the disease.,FMOH
"Additional objectives are to prevent transmission, and the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines.",FMOH
The treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria is Artemisinin Based Combination Therapy.,FMOH
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies are combination medicines consisting of an artemisinin derivative and another effective long acting schizonticidal antimalarial medicine.,FMOH
The recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Nigeria are Artemether-Lumefantrine and Artesunate-Amodiaquine.,FMOH
Artemether-Lumefantrine It is available as co-formulated.,FMOH
Each tablet contains twenty miligram artemether and one hundred and twenty miligram lumefantrine.,FMOH
It is important to emphasize that the six doses must be taken by the patient.,FMOH
The first two doses should be taken between eight to twelve hours apart.,FMOH
Absorption of the medicine is enhanced by fatty meals.,FMOH
Artesunate-Amodiaquine It is available as co-formulated and co-packaged.,FMOH
The co-formulated medicines are however preferred.,FMOH
Monotherapy with any artemisinin derivatives and other antimalarial medicines are not recommended in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.,FMOH
It should be noted that Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine is not a combination therapy and should not be used as such.,FMOH
"In Nigeria, the use of Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine is restricted to pregnant women as Intermittent Preventive Treatment.",FMOH
"Persistent Vomiting If a patient vomits the medicine within thirty minutes, repeat the dose.",FMOH
"If this is vomited again and the vomiting becomes persistent, the patient should be considered as having severe malaria and managed accordingly.",FMOH
"If a patient has a seizure and does not recover within thirty minutes from that seizure, it should be considered as severe malaria.",FMOH
Children less than five kilogram Malaria in children less than five kilogram can be serious and may progress to severe disease with increased risk of dying if not treated promptly.,FMOH
Artemisinin derivatives are safe and well tolerated by young children.,FMOH
Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies can be used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in infants and young children but attention must be given to accurate dosing and the providers must ensure that the administered dose is retained.,FMOH
Oral quinine ten miligram base per kiligram every eight hours for seven days and other supportive therapy can also be used for treatment.,FMOH
Falciparum malaria in pregnancy carries a high mortality for the foetus and increased morbidity for the pregnant woman.,FMOH
Quinine is safe for the treatment of malaria in all trimesters of pregnancy.,FMOH
In the second and third trimester Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies can be used.,FMOH
However there should be proper monitoring and documentation in all cases.,FMOH
In the first trimester the safety of the Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies has not been ascertained for a categorical recommendation on their use.,FMOH
"However, should be used if it is the only effective antimalarial medicine available.",FMOH
Lactating mothers should also be treated with recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies.,FMOH
One of the strategies introduced to improve access and rapidly scale up malaria diagnosis and treatment is the introduction of community management of malaria.,FMOH
They also recognize symptoms of severe malaria and support the referral process.,FMOH
Recommended medicines for the treatment of malaria at community level is as recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.,FMOH
Artemisinin Combination Therapy is the recommended medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated Malaria.,FMOH
Artemether-Lumefantrine and Artesunate-Amodiaquine are the recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies for programmatic use in Nigeria.,FMOH
MALARIA Management of severe malaria should be carried out in secondary facilities with adequate facilities to manage complications or at specialist facility.,FMOH
"b. Cerebral Malaria: For a diagnosis of cerebral malaria, the following criteria should be met:",FMOH
"Deep, unarousable coma: Motor response to noxious stimuli is non- localising or absent.",FMOH
However management should be instituted once there is an altered consciousness.,FMOH
Exclusion of other encephalopathies:,FMOH
"Confirmation of P. falciparum infection: c. Abnormal neurological manifestations: Convulsions may be as a result of very high temperature, hypoglycaemia, hypoxaemia, severe anaemia or the effect of herbal concoction.",FMOH
"d. Hypoglycaemia: This may occur as a result of decreased intake, increased glucose utilization; antimalarial mediated reduction, glycogen depletion or impaired gluconeogenesis.",FMOH
"e. Acidosis: This is due to elevated levels of lactic acid which results from tissue anaerobic glycolysis, particularly in skeletal muscles.",FMOH
f. Breathing difficulties: Patients with severe malaria may present with difficulty in breathing as a result of any of the following: Heart failure resulting from severe anaemia.,FMOH
Pulmonary oedema (following administration of excessive fluids) usually there is frothing from the mouth and marked respiratory distress.,FMOH
Acidosis causes deep and rapid respiration.,FMOH
Aspiration g. Renal Failure: Renal failure develops due to low blood pressure as a result of dehydration or shock.,FMOH
"H. Haemoglobinuria: This occurs as a result of excessive breakdown of red blood cells by parasites or drugs like sulphonamides and primaquine, especially in G6PD deficiency patients.",FMOH
Progressive weakness should immediately alert you that the patient may be developing Severe malaria.,FMOH
Abnormal behaviour or altered consciousness: ask relatives to tell you any observed changes in the patients behaviour since the illness started or when the unresponsiveness started.,FMOH
"Convulsions: ask about the number of episodes, part of the body involved, previous history and time onset of last episode.",FMOH
Focal or multiple convulsions over a period of twenty four hours is indicative of severe disease.,FMOH
Drowsiness or deteriorating level of consciousness.,FMOH
Time of last drink or food since the onset of the illness.,FMOH
Fast breathing which may occur due to pulmonary oedema or acidosis.,FMOH
Reduced urinary output (time patient last passed urine).,FMOH
Colour of urine: whether dark or coca-cola coloured (this may suggest excessive breakdown of red blood cells or dehydration).,FMOH
Pregnancy: in adult females.,FMOH
"Drug History: Ask about antimalarial drugs, salicylates and herbal concoctions that may influence treatment or cause some of the symptoms.",FMOH
"Previous illnesses: Ask about any history of recent febrile illness and treatment which may suggest treatment failure or relapse (consider typhoid, malaria and other infections).",FMOH
In the physical examination you should aim at  Assessing for the presence of signs of severe malaria.,FMOH
Identifying other possible causes of disease.,FMOH
"Respiratory System: Check for respiratory distress (fast, deep or laboured breathing) - Listen to the chest for rales or other added sounds.",FMOH
"Examine the rate, rhythm and volume of the pulse.",FMOH
Cold extremities or poor capillary refill at the tips of the fingers (delay for greater than three seconds).,FMOH
Check blood pressure d. Abdomen Feel for the spleen and the liver 7.6 Differential Diagnosis: Meningitis- Patient may have a stiff neck.,FMOH
Encephalopathy- Repeated convulsions or deep coma.,FMOH
"Diabetes Mellitus- Patient may be dehydrated, acidotic or in coma.",FMOH
Septicaemia- Usually very ill and toxic with warm extremities.,FMOH
Epilepsy- Usually no temperature and will have history of convulsions before.,FMOH
Recommended tests include: Blood smear for malaria parasites Haematocrit (PCV)/Haemoglobin Blood sugar level Lumbar puncture in unconscious patients.,FMOH
Urinalysis for:- Sugar (to exclude diabetes) Proteins (exclude pregnancy-induced hypertension) Notes about Diagnosis of Severe malaria,FMOH
High index of suspicion in patients with fever and any of the features discussed above.,FMOH
Absence of fever does not exclude a diagnosis of severe malaria.,FMOH
"Microscopic diagnosis should not delay antimalarial treatment if there is a clinical suspicion of severe malaria, with-holding treatment may be fatal.",FMOH
Patients progress should be monitored and management changed as deemed necessary.,FMOH
Severe malaria is a medical emergency requiring in-patient care.,FMOH
Deaths from severe malaria can result either from direct effect of the disease or the complications.,FMOH
The provider should attend to the immediate threats to life first.,FMOH
Life threatening emergencies Coma or unconscious patient.  Ensure airway is patent,FMOH
Make sure the patient is breathing.,FMOH
Nurse the patient lying on the side or with the head sideways.,FMOH
Insert a naso-gastric tube (NGT).,FMOH
Establish an intravenous line.,FMOH
It will be necessary for giving drugs and fluids.,FMOH
Correct hypoglycaemia: Children: zero point five mililitre per kilogram of fifty percent dextrose diluted to ten to fifteen percent.,FMOH
Adults: twenty five mililitre of fifty percentdextrose.,FMOH
Convulsions  Ensure patent airway and that the patient is breathing.,FMOH
Correct hypoglycaemia or control temperature.,FMOH
In children give rectal diazepamzero point five miligram per kilogram or IM paraldehyde zero point one mililitre per kilogram.,FMOH
"If convulsions continue, give IM phenobarbitone ten to fifteen miligram per kilogram.",FMOH
In adults give ten miligram diazepam IV.,FMOH
Severe dehydration or shock  Give twenty to thirty mililitre per kilogram of normal saline and reassess the patient within thirty minutes to decide on the next fluid requirement according to the degree of dehydration.,FMOH
After correction of the fluid deficit it is important to reduce the maintenance fluid to two thirds of the required volume when the patient is well hydrated.,FMOH
Severe Anaemia  Give urgent blood transfusion to patients with severe pallor/anaemia in heart failure.,FMOH
"The blood must be screened to ensure that it is HIV, Hepatitis B and C negative.",FMOH
Use packed cells (ten mililitre per kilogram in children) or whole blood (plus frusemide).,FMOH
"Where blood is not available, give pre-referral treatment and refer urgently to a health facility with blood transfusion services.",FMOH
Treatment Objectives- The primary objective of antimalarial treatment in severe malaria is to prevent the patient from dying.,FMOH
The secondary objectives are prevention of disabilities and recrudescence.,FMOH
The antimalaria medicines recommended for the treatment of severe malaria in Nigeria is Intravenous or intramuscular Artesunate.,FMOH
"Where this is not readily available, intravenous or intramuscular quinine, intramuscular artemether can be used as alternative.",FMOH
"i. Artesunate Recommended Dosages: Givetwo point four miligram per kilogram body weight IV or IM stat, repeat after twelve hours and twenty four hours, then once daily for six days.",FMOH
"However once patient regains consciousness and can take orally, discontinue parenteral therapy and commence full course of recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.",FMOH
"Quinine: It is administered by either IV or IM route, depending on the availability of infusion facilities.",FMOH
Recommended dosage: Intravenous quinine Children: Give twenty miligram per kilogram of Quinine dihydrochloride salt as loading dose diluted in ten mililitre per kilogram of four.Three percent dextrose in zero point one eight percent saline or five percent dextrose over a period of four hours.,FMOH
"Then twelve hours after the start of the loading dose, give ten miligram salt per kilogram infusion over four hours every eight hours until when patient is able to take orally.",FMOH
Change to quinine tablets ten miligram per kilogram eight hourly to complete a total of seven days treatment OR give a full course of recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.,FMOH
Then give a full dose of recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.,FMOH
"NOTE:  If intravenous quinine is required for over forty eight hours, reduce the dose to five to seven miligram per kilogram to avoid toxicity.",FMOH
A practical way of doing this is to reduce the dosing frequency to every twelve hours  If there is a history of prior administration of quinine or mefloquine in appropriate doses in the last twenty four hours do not use loading dose.,FMOH
"Intramuscular Quinine: Where intravenous access is not possible give quinine dihydrochloride intramuscularly at a dosage of twenty miligram per kilogram salt (loading dose), diluted to sixty miligram per mililitre, and continue with a maintenance dose of ten miligram per kilogram eight hourly until patient is able to take orally.",FMOH
Thereafter change to oral quinine at ten miligram per kilogram eight hourly to complete a seven- day treatment OR give a full dose of recommended Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.,FMOH
Quinine comes in highly concentrated salt (two mililitre ampoule containing 600mg quinine dihydrochloride).,FMOH
It is recommended that quinine be diluted to sixty to one hundred miligram per mililitre before administering intramuscularly.,FMOH
"To achieve sixty miligram per mililitre concentration, add four mililitres of sterile water to one mililitre of quinine salt to make up to five mililitres.",FMOH
"NOTE: Intramuscular injections should be given with sterile precautions into the anterior or lateral thigh, NOT THE GLUTEAL REGION.",FMOH
Treatment of severe malaria in pregnancy First Trimester: Current body of evidence is not conclusive on the safety of artemisinin derivatives in the first trimester.,FMOH
"However, the risk of death from severe malaria far outweighs the potential risk of artesunate to the foetus, therefore parenteral Artesunate can be used for treating severe malaria during pregnancy.",FMOH
The use of Quinine is safe during the first trimester of pregnancy.,FMOH
"Quinine in pregnancy: Quinine is administered as ten miligram per kilogram body weight orally to a maximum dose of six hundred miligram eight hourly, for seven days.",FMOH
"Quinine is safe in pregnancy and it does not cause abortion or premature delivery when given in normal therapeutic dose, rather it is the malaria that causes these complications.",FMOH
Second and Third trimesters: The treatment of severe malaria in these periods of pregnancy is as recommended for all adults.,FMOH
"Supportive Treatment High temperature: Give paracetamol (rectal) if temperature is greater than thirty eight point five degree celcius, in children, also tepid sponge (wipe the body with towel soaked in lukewarm water), avoid over -clothing.",FMOH
"Pulmonary oedema  Prop up the patient at an angle of forty five degrees, give oxygen and frusemide two to four miligram per kilogram IV, stop intravenous fluids and exclude other causes of pulmonary oedema.. Renal failure  Give fluids if patient is dehydrated twenty mililitre per kilogram of normal saline and challenge with frusemide one to two miligram per kilogram.",FMOH
Pass a urinary catheter to monitor urinary output.,FMOH
If patient does not pass urine within the next twenty four hours refer for peritoneal or haemodialysis.,FMOH
"Exclude pre-renal causes Profuse bleeding  Transfuse with screened fresh whole blood, give pre-referral treatment and refer urgently.",FMOH
"Other possible treatments:- If meningitis is suspected, and cannot be immediately excluded by a lumbar puncture, appropriate antibiotics should be given.",FMOH
Other severe diseases should be treated accordingly.,FMOH
The following drugs have no role in the treatment of severe malaria.,FMOH
Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents  Agents used for cerebral oedema e.g.,FMOH
Urea Adrenaline  Heparin. Severe malaria is a serious condition and the clinicians and nurses should closely monitor patients.,FMOH
Therefore nursing care should include all the following:,FMOH
Monitor vital signs,FMOH
Temperature,FMOH
Respiratory rate,FMOH
Blood pressure: These should be monitored at least every 6 hours but may be more frequent at the initial stages.,FMOH
Monitor input and output A strict 24-hour input / output chart should be kept in all patients with severe malaria.,FMOH
Examine regularly for signs of dehydration or fluid overload.,FMOH
Monitoring unconscious patient Unconscious or comatose patients need close monitoring of all vital signs more regularly to assess their progress.,FMOH
Monitor the level of consciousness at least every 6 hours.,FMOH
Patients should be turned in bed regularly to avoid bedsores.,FMOH
"Drug chart A drug chart where all drugs given are recorded should be kept and should include dose given, time given and number of times a day.",FMOH
Pregnant women They should be monitored closely ensuring the well being of the foetus and preventing the development of maternal hypoglycaemia.,FMOH
Watch out for signs of severe anaemia and pulmonary oedema.,FMOH
Monitor the parasitaemia. Do blood smears daily.,FMOH
"If high after two to three days, review adequacy of the medicine dosages.",FMOH
Monitor blood glucose Do blood glucose level or maintain with dextrose containing infusion,FMOH
"Monitor Haemoglobin/haematocrit Assessment of recovery When the patient recovers, assess for possible residual problems of the disease or treatment.",FMOH
Assess the ability of the patient to do what he/she was able to do before the illness.,FMOH
Assess vision and hearing by asking whether they can see or hear,FMOH
Organize for follow up of the patient.,FMOH
Management of residual disability might require a multi-disciplinary approach.,FMOH
"To survive, a patient with severe illness must get access rapidly to a health facility where parenteral treatment and other supportive care can be given safely and as appropriate.",FMOH
The affected patient may die on the way to hospital or be admitted with advanced disease and complications.,FMOH
Artesunate suppositories The appropriate single dose of Artesunate suppositories should be administered rectally as soon as the presumptive diagnosis of malaria is made.,FMOH
Dose should be given once and followed as soon as possible by definitive therapy for malaria.,FMOH
Intra-rectal pre-referral treatment Intra-rectal artemether at the dose of tent to forty miligram per kilogram body weight and intra- rectal quinine at twelve miligram per kilogram body weight can also be used as alternative based on availability.,FMOH
The high prevalence of malaria during pregnancy has been associated with pregnancy-associated immune changes and the extensive proliferation of the parasites within the placenta.,FMOH
"In high transmission areas such as Nigeria, malaria is usually asymptomatic during pregnancy.",FMOH
The use of Intermittent Preventive  Severe malaria is a medical emergency.,FMOH
Full doses of parenteral antimalarial treatment should be commenced without delay with an effective antimalaria first available after rapid clinical assessment and confirmation of diagnosis.,FMOH
"Artesunate two point four miligram per kilogram IV or IM given at time zero, twelve and twenty four hours, then once daily is the recommended treatment.",FMOH
Quinine is an acceptable alternative if parenteral artesunate is not available.,FMOH
"Quinine twenty miligram salt per kilogram IV or divided IM injection, then ten miligram per kilogram every eight hours, infusion rate should not exceed five miligram salt per kilogram per hour.",FMOH
"IM artemether three point two miligram per kilogram given on admission, then one point six miligram per kilogram per day should be used if none of the alternatives are available as its absorption may be erratic.",FMOH
"Give parenteral antimalarial medicines in the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of twenty four hours, once started (irrespective of the patients ability to tolerate oral medications earlier) and thereafter complete treatment by giving a complete course of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy.",FMOH
Treatment with Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine has been shown to be effective in preventing several malaria related complications during pregnancy.,FMOH
IPT is given as a one-dose of a full course treatment after Quickening as Directly Observed Therapy and the second dose is given not earlier than one month after the first dose.,FMOH
A single dose is three tablets of SP each containing Sulphadoxine five hundred  miligram plus Pyrimethamine (twenty five miligram).,FMOH
"Pregnant women who are HIV positive and are on Co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis, should not receive IPT.",FMOH
This is because of their increased risk to the adverse effects of the Sulphonamides.,FMOH
Encourage them to use other preventive measures such as regular use of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets.,FMOH
"Malaria chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for individuals living in areas of intense transmission, however, people with sickle cell anaemia and non immune visitors are expected to be on regular chemoprophylaxis.",FMOH
There is however no effective antimalarial presently available for long term chemoprophylaxis.,FMOH
"Until such becomes available, these risk group should be targeted with other preventive interventions",FMOH
ITNs and also ensuring that they have ready access to effective case management.,FMOH
The recommended chemoprophylaxis for non immune visitors will be as available in the visitors country of origin.,FMOH
"The following options are recommended for use in Nigeria; Mefloquine, and atovaquone- proguanil.",FMOH
Doses should be taken prior to arrival in Nigeria and continued during the stay and following departure from the country.,FMOH
"Mefloquine five miligram base per kg weekly, giving an adult dose of two hundred and fifty miligram of base per week.",FMOH
It should be started two to three weeks prior to arrival and two to three weeks after departure.,FMOH
Atovaquone-Proguanil Exist as a fixed dose combination.,FMOH
Commence one to two days before travel and continue throughout the stay and seven days after return.,FMOH
Antimalarial drug resistance is defined as the ability of a parasite strain to survive and/or multiply despite the proper administration and absorption of an antimalarial medicines in the dose normally recommended.,FMOH
It has resulted in a global resurgence of malaria and it is a major threat to malaria control.,FMOH
Widespread and indiscriminate use of antimalarial drugs places a strong selective pressure on malaria parasites to evolve mechanisms of resistance.,FMOH
Prevention of antimalarial drug resistance is one of the main goals of these antimalarial treatment recommendations.,FMOH
"Resistance can be prevented by combining antimalarial medicines with different mechanisms of action, and ensuring very high cure rates through full adherence to correct dose regimens.",FMOH
This is summarized below.,FMOH
"While drug resistance may lead to treatment failure, not all treatment failures are caused by drug resistance.",FMOH
Other causes of treatment failure are  Incorrect dosing  Problems of treatment compliance  Poor drug quality  Interactions with other drugs. The impact of antimalarial drug resistance is insidious initially.,FMOH
The initial symptoms of the infection resolve and the patient is better for weeks.,FMOH
"When symptoms recur, usually more than two weeks later, anaemia has worsened, and there is a greater probability of carrying gametocytes (which in turn carry the resistance genes) and transmitting malaria.",FMOH
But the patient and the doctor or dispenser may interpret this as a newly acquired infection.,FMOH
"At this stage unless drug trials are conducted, resistance may be unrecognised.",FMOH
"As resistance worsens the interval between primary infection and recrudescence shortens, until eventually the symptoms fail to resolve.",FMOH
At this stage mortality begins to rise.,FMOH
Antimalarial medicine resistance accounts for our failure to control malaria in many areas of the tropical world and the consequent increasing global mortality.,FMOH
"But resistance can be prevented, or its onset slowed considerably with judicial use of the limited number of effective drugs currently available to treat malaria.",FMOH
Chloroquine resistance is now widespread globally.,FMOH
It is no longer recommended either alone or as a combination partner for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.,FMOH
Amodiaquine Amodiaquine is a Mannich base four amino-quinoline that interferes with parasite heam detoxification.,FMOH

"Following oral administration, bioavailability is variable but can be improved by administration with fatty foods.",FMOH
"Toxicity includes nausea, abdominal discomfort, headache and dizziness.",FMOH
It is critical that QA ensure:  the clinical teams have full confidence in the laboratory results  the diagnostic results are of benefit to the patient and the community.,FMOH
"The principles and concepts of QA for microscopic diagnosis of malaria are similar to those for microscopic diagnosis of other communicable diseases, such as other protozoan diseases, tuberculosis and helminth infections.",FMOH
This provides a potential for the integration of laboratory services where it is feasible and cost-effective.,FMOH

"Methanol is not oily (test place some methanol on the fingers, it should not be sticky).",FMOH
There is no deformation or blistering of red blood cells in the thin blood film (this is caused by poor quality methanol).,FMOH
The methanol used for slide fixing is stored in moisture-proof containers.,FMOH
Giemsa Stain Only stain prepared from high quality Giemsa powder is used.,FMOH
Commercial Giemsa stain is supplied to the laboratory in the original sealed.,FMOH
The stain is within the manufacturers expiry date.,FMOH
"The laboratory has a Stain QC Register recording the batch number and expiry date of supplies received the QC results on each batch (staining time, staining quality, and optimal pH of use) and any problems encountered.",FMOH
Stock stain is stored in a dark glass bottle tightly sealed.,FMOH
Stock stain is not stored in direct sunlight or near a heat source.,FMOH
The stock stain used by the laboratory was prepared less than two years ago.,FMOH
Stained blood films do not contain stain precipitate.,FMOH
Diluted Giemsa stain Stock stain is always diluted in buffer to the correct pH.,FMOH
The diluted stain contains no stain precipitate.,FMOH
The surface of the diluted stain does not have an oily appearance.,FMOH
For horizontal slide staining (using a staining rack) this is best observed after the stain has been added to the slides.,FMOH
This effect can be caused by poor quality methanol used to prepare Giemsa stain from powder.,FMOH
Diluted stain is always discarded within fifteen minutes of preparation.,FMOH
Thick blood films greater than ninety five percent of thick films have the correct thickness.,FMOH
It should be just possible to read newsprint through the thick film while it is still wet.,FMOH
There is flaking in the centre of the smear (a hole in the centre of the thick film) in less than two percent of the thick films.,FMOH
one hundred percent of the thick films are correctly stained.,FMOH
None of the thick films contain stain precipitate contamination.,FMOH
There a protocol for the preparation of thick films of the correct thickness from patients with severe anaemia.,FMOH
Slide warmers may be used with caution in high humidity settings.,FMOH
Thin blood films greater than ninety five percent of the thin films have a smooth semi-circular tail.,FMOH
In greater than ninety five percent of the thin films the red cells are just touching and not overlapping in approximately twenty percent to thirty percent of the film (the reading area).,FMOH
Thin films are fixed immediately after drying.,FMOH
The laboratory has a pH meter that reads to two decimal places.,FMOH
Staining The pH meter is calibrated with calibration buffers according to manufacturers directions.,FMOH
pH adjusted buffer always used to prepare diluted Giemsa.,FMOH
The pH of the buffer is calibrated for each batch of Giemsa.,FMOH
Slides are always washed in water of the same pH as the buffer used for Giemsa dilution.,FMOH
The diluted Giemsa is always prepared in a clean measuring cylinder.,FMOH
There is an absolute rule that the diluted Giemsa stain is discarded in less than fifteen minutes after preparation.,FMOH
The trophozoite chromatin stains red to rusty red.,FMOH
The trophozoite cytoplasm stains blue to strong blue.,FMOH
The thick film background is stained light pink to grey.,FMOH
The red cells in the thin film are stained pink.,FMOH
The nuclear lobes of the polymorphs are stained significantly darker than the cytoplasm.,FMOH
Slides are always washed from the thin film end.,FMOH
All slides are washed gently by a technique that floats the stain off with minimal without disturbing the thick film.,FMOH
Laboratory staff who perform staining have protective clothing to protect their personal clothing.,FMOH
Counting The laboratory reports the actual number of trophozoites when required against five hundred (two hundred) WBC.,FMOH
All laboratory staff who report malaria examination results read a minimum of ten thick blood films each month.,FMOH
Laboratory staff always read a minimum of one hundred fields before reporting a film as negative.,FMOH
"There is no pressure on microscopists to read slides more quickly than the standard reading time (such as end of day, urgent cases).",FMOH
Is there a laboratory protocol that ensures that microscopists do not continuously read malaria slides for more than 3 hours without a thirty minute break?,FMOH
Species identification Thin films are available for species identification where a mixed infection is suspected or species identification is unclear on the thick film.,FMOH
The main focus of QC is on reproducibility (precision) of results.,FMOH
The programme is used within the laboratory for checking its own performance.,FMOH
Quality control is the responsibility of the laboratory chief but all laboratory personnel must be involved.,FMOH
"Standard operating procedures (SOPs) need to be developed, depending on the type of analyses carried out at each level of the health services so that tests can be performed in an acceptable standard way.",FMOH
The SOPs should state clearly the minimum QC for each method or test.,FMOH
"By standardizing test procedures, it allows easier clinical and epidemiological interpretation of the results.",FMOH
"Troubleshooting guides for equipment, reagents and methods would be useful additions to the more isolate laboratories where instant help is not available.",FMOH
"With such a multitude of steps involved in processing of a specimen, errors can occur at any stage.",FMOH
Laboratory management needs to be aware where errors can happen to reduce the possibility of their occurrence.,FMOH
"Therefore, all stages from the preparation through to the examination must be monitored.",FMOH
Below quality controls issues will focus on microscopy and rapid tests.,FMOH
The general points are equally pertinent for all techniques.,FMOH
"Blood smears-preparation and staining Blood should be taken from a finger prick, when possible.",FMOH
Blood collected in anticoagulant causes morphological changes to the parasite if left too long before examination.,FMOH
Anticoagulant also causes thick smears not to stick well onto the slide.,FMOH
The specimen should be clearly labelled and be accompanied with correctly completed form (clinical request or field).,FMOH
"If blood films in high temperature environments are not stained within a couple of days, the films suffer auto fixation.",FMOH
Smears stored in humid and hot conditions facilitate the growth of fungus and bacteria.,FMOH
"Similarly, dusty conditions cause the formation of deposits making the smear unreadable or the deposits might be confused for parasites leading to a false result.",FMOH
"Smears, both stained and unstained must be protected from the voracious appetites of cockroaches, flies and ants and should where possible be stored in slide boxes.",FMOH
"The smears need to be well stained to facilitate the reading and if using Giemsa, species determination and accurate parasite counts.",FMOH
A stain can either be commercial or house made.,FMOH
It is imperative that each batch be checked by comparing batches of new staining solution with the old on the same group of thick and thin films.,FMOH
House made stain is not necessarily reliable and requires high quality reagents.,FMOH
"Standardized forms must be draw up that indicate the stain, the lot number, the producer and the dilutions used to determine concentration and staining time and the result.",FMOH
Dilution/buffer solutions also need to be controlled.,FMOH
"With Giemsa stain often used, well water is the normal choice of diluents as the supply of reagents to the periphery is poor.",FMOH
Unfiltered stain and metallic scum of the staining solution leaves as precipitate on the thick film which are often confused with parasites.,FMOH
Working solution should be prepared daily to avoid de-naturation and even changed during the day depending on the workload.,FMOH
Maintenance of a microscope is very important.,FMOH
It is an expensive piece of equipment that in poor condition cannot aid the microscopist to read the slide.,FMOH
Humid atmosphere can cause the growth of fungus especially on the lens.,FMOH
"Other problems are the bad alignment of the microscope, immersion oil not wiped from the objective and condenser leaving a coating.",FMOH
"Other materials to monitor are the slides and lancets, lancets should be sterile and preferably single use and slide should be without oily residue.",FMOH
Recommended procedure notes  Make a thick and a thin film on a clean microscope slide  Stain with Giemsa method.,FMOH
Examine under a high power objective starting with thick and then thin films.,FMOH
"If the repeat slide is positive, treat accordingly.",FMOH
Rapid Staining Method,FMOH
Fix the thin film by dabbing it with a pad of cotton wool dampened with methanol or by briefly dipping the film into methanol.,FMOH
"Avoid contact between the thick film and methanol, as methanol and its vapours quickly fix the thick film, and make it not to stain well.",FMOH
"Using a test tube or a small container to hold the prepared stain, make up a ten percent solution of Giemsa in the buffered water by mixing three drops of Giemsa from the stock solution, using the Pasteur pipette, with one mililitre of buffered water.",FMOH
Each slide needs approximately three mililitre of stain to cover it.,FMOH
Malaria Parasite Density Determination: This is a practical method of reasonable and acceptable accuracy.,FMOH
The number of parasites per microlitre of blood in a thick film is counted in relation to a standard number of leukocytes (eight thousand).,FMOH
"Although there are variations in the number of leukocytes between healthy individuals and even greater variations between individuals in ill health, this standard allows for reasonable comparisons.",FMOH
"Step two: (a) In routine practice, using a times one hundred oil immersion objective and an eyepiece with a field number of eighteen, parasite quantitation is performed against two hundred or five hundred WBCs.",FMOH
"(b) If, after counting two hundred WBC, one hundred or more parasites are found, record the results in terms of number of parasites per two hundred WBC.",FMOH
"(c) If less than one hundred parasites are found after counting two hundred WBCs, parasite four.",FMOH
"Depending on whether you are using a staining tray, plate or rack, place the slides to be stained face down on the curved staining tray or face upwards on the plate or rack tray until each slide is covered with stain, or gently pour the stain onto the slides lying face upwards on the plate or rack.",FMOH
Stain the films for eight hundred and ten minutes.,FMOH
Experience with the stain you are using will help you to decide the exact time needed for good staining.,FMOH
Gently wash the stain from the slide by adding drops of clean water.,FMOH
"Do not pour the stain directly off the slides, or the metallic-green surface scum will stick to the film, spoiling it for microscopy.",FMOH
"When the stain has been washed away, place the slides in the drying rack, film side downwards, to drain and dry.",FMOH
Ensure that thick films do not scrape the edge of the rack.,FMOH
quantification should be continued until five hundred WBCs are counted.,FMOH
All parasites in the final field are counted even if the count exceeds five hundred WBCs.,FMOH
"Step two: To determine parasite density, the parasite count is adjusted against the true WCC where available.",FMOH
"If unavailable, the common practice is to assume a WCC of eight thousand per litre.",FMOH
Note: It is normal practice to count all the species present and to count and record separately the gametocytes of P. falciparum and the asexual parasites.,FMOH
"This is particularly important when monitoring the response to schizontocidal drugs, which would not be expected to have any effects on the gametocytes.",FMOH
Re-examination of Blood Slides Cross- checking in malaria diagnosis is part of supervision activities and involves the re examination of a proportion of positive and negatives slides from each laboratory.,FMOH
Cross checking of slides provides the supervisor with information about the accuracy of the examination by scientist and criteria for improvement if required.,FMOH
An idea about the quality of the preparation can also be ascertained.,FMOH
Measurement of quality Assessment can be made on three different areas.,FMOH
"These areas are;  Positive and negative readings  Intensity of infection  Species identification Intensity of infection Before now, only positive and negative results have been discussed.",FMOH
"The results from the majority of routine malaria diagnosis tests have been given in a semi-quantitative fashion (plus system) but in epidemiological studies, parasite density is always applied.",FMOH
The frequency of agreement and disagreement between laboratories can be calculated by using kappa statistics.,FMOH
"For semi-quantitative results, which are subjective, a two- step grading of positive could suffice those slides that have parasites in every field and those that have less than one parasite per field.",FMOH
This would certainly be sufficient to determine those failing to detect low parasitaemia from those failing to detect parasites at all.,FMOH
Species identification Misdiagnosis of the species can be addressed.,FMOH
This is particularly important where there is high degree of chloroquine resistance of both P. falciparum and P. vivax.,FMOH
The type of species determined the treatment that is given.,FMOH
"In Nigeria, where over 90 percent of single infections are due to P. falciparum, non- recognition of the other species would cause mis- readings of about ten percent of the slides, which is a considerable proportion of error.",FMOH
Wear your latex gloves ,FMOH
Open an Rapid Diagnostic Test cassette and write the name of the patient and date.,FMOH
Swab patients fourth finger (the left hand of a right handed person) with methylated spirit and allow to dry (this will ensure that the patients blood collects and not spread around the finger).,FMOH
Take an unused lancet and prick the tip of the swabbed finger and discard lancet in the sharps quickly (do not re-cap the lancet). Five,FMOH
Get the blood transfer device and collect the recommended volume of blood. Six,FMOH
Dispense the blood in the well (allow the transfer device to touch the pad in the well before releasing the content so that the blood collected is deposited fully insufficient blood can give a false result). Seven,FMOH
Dispose transfer immediately (do not leave on your table). Eight,FMOH
"Put the recommended drops of buffer in the buffer well (ensure that the buffer container faces the well vertically, a little above the Rapid Diagnostic Test cassette do not allow buffer to spill on the side of the well).",FMOH
Note: the time immediately by writing the start time on the cassette.,FMOH
Also indicate the stop time by adding the recommended time for the test.,FMOH
"For example, if you were to read the test result after fifteen minutes, add fifteen minutes to the start time to get the stop time.",FMOH
Interpret the result at the recommended time and not after as this could give you a false result.,FMOH
"In all suspected cases of an adverse drug reaction, the Pharmacovigilance form from NAFDAC should be completed at all levels of care.",FMOH
It is necessary to complete all section of the adverse drug reaction form.,FMOH

Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure.,WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination.,WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started twenty three weeks before departure.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for four weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.,WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024

"The intensity of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector, the human host, and the environment.The female mosquitoes seek a blood meal to nurture their eggs.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
Malaria epidemics can occur when climate and other conditions suddenly favour transmission in areas where people have little or no immunity to malaria.,WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"They can also occur when people with low immunity move into areas with intense malaria transmission, for instance to find work, or as refugees.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"Human immunity is another important factor, especially among adults in areas of moderate or intense transmission conditions.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024

"Treatment Artemisinin-based combination therapy has become the standard treatment of uncomplicated malaria.More detailed recommendations are available in the  World Health Organisation Guidelines for the treatment of malaria, third edition, published in April year two thousand and fifteen.",WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
There are currently no licensed vaccines against malaria or any other human parasite.,WHO Malaria Fact Sheet 2024
"This National Policy on Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment describes the goal of the Federal Ministry of Health, with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of malaria and the strategy by which the goal is to be achieved.",FMOH
The primary goal of treatment of malaria is to cure the patient of the infection and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality.,FMOH
A second purpose is to encourage the rational and safe use of medicines to prevent or delay the development of antimalarial medicine resistance.,FMOH
"The ultimate public health objective of treating malaria infections is to reduce the reservoir of infection and, therefore, malaria transmission which, in turn, will result in reducing morbidity and mortality.",FMOH
"Malaria is an eminently preventable, treatable and curable infection.",FMOH
Medicines and other interventions for its prevention and treatment are widely available.,FMOH
Many of these are easy to apply and are affordable and accessible.,FMOH
"There is therefore, no justification for Nigeria to continue to suffer under the severe disease and economic burden brought upon it by malaria.",FMOH
"In order to steadily reduce and, ultimately, eliminate the burden of malaria on Nigerians, we need to know more about what has made the disease persist at such a high level in our population.",FMOH
"As malaria is not the only cause of fever in the country, the employment of quality diagnosis is an important step in confirming patients with malaria that should be given antimalarial medicine.",FMOH
"Parasite-based confirmation of malaria will ensure that patients condition is appropriately diagnosed to avoid the overuse of antimalarial medicines, provide best practices, and rationalize antimalarial use to avoid the onset of parasite resistance to current antimalarial medicines.",FMOH
"In the fight against malaria, new remedies need to be developed and deployed to replace older ones with waning efficacy.",FMOH
"Perhaps, more importantly, we need to develop a more effective use of existing remedies.",FMOH
Roll Back Malaria is a global initiative that has set specific deadlines for the attainment of explicitly defined milestones.,FMOH
The RBM intervention strategy has four key elements as follows: one,FMOH
Patients with malaria would have access to appropriate and adequate treatment within twenty four hours of the onset of symptoms; two,FMOH
"Pregnant women, particularly in their first and second pregnancies would have access to effective antimalarial prophylaxis and treatment; three",FMOH
"Insecticide treated nets and other materials would be available and accessible to persons at risk of malaria, particularly pregnant women and children under five years of age; four",FMOH
Epidemics of malaria would be recognised and steps initiated for their containment within one week of their onset.,FMOH
"It is obvious that achieving the goal of this policy would require the availability of appropriate antimalarial medicines and their proper management, including their storage and rational and safe use.",FMOH
This means that proper financial provisions should be made at all levels to make these medicines available either free or at highly subsidized costs.,FMOH
The consumers and providers have to be properly educated on malaria and its treatment.,FMOH
"As well, an effective monitoring and evaluation system has to be set up to ensure that set objectives would be properly pursued.",FMOH
"The need for a new understanding of old problem is also important, and new challenges would require clarification as they arise.",FMOH
All of these call for continued strategic as well as operational research.,FMOH
These and other issues are addressed in this policy document.,FMOH
Malaria is one of the common causes of hospital attendance in all age groups in all parts of Nigeria.,FMOH
"It is also one of the four commonest causes of childhood mortality in the country, the other three being acute respiratory infection (pneumonia), diarrhoea and measles.",FMOH
"It is estimated that fifty percent of the Nigerian population has at least one episode of malaria each year, while children under 5 have, on the average of two to four attacks in a year.",FMOH
Malaria has severe negative effects on maternal health and birth outcomes.,FMOH
"It causes maternal anaemia, increases miscarriage and low birth weight.",FMOH
P. falciparum is the most predominant parasite specie accounting for about 98 percent of malaria cases in the country.,FMOH
P. malariae usually occurs as a mixed infection with P. falciparum.,FMOH
"Anopheles gambiae is the main vector of malaria in Nigeria, ",FMOH
"Malaria is characterized by a stable, perennial transmission in all parts of the country.",FMOH
Transmission is most intense in the wet season as compared to the dry season.,FMOH
This seasonal difference is more striking in the northern part of the country.,FMOH
Malaria impedes human development and is both a cause and consequence of under development.,FMOH
"Every year, the nation loses several billions of naira, derived from cost of malaria treatment and absenteeism from work, schools and farms.",FMOH
"In the year year one thousand nine hundred and ninety six, Nigeria developed its first National Malaria Control Policy.",FMOH
A yearly Plan of Action was developed for year one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and a three-year Plan of Action was also developed for year one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine to year two thousand and one.,FMOH
The Malaria Control units in the States were revitalized or reestablished and public awareness of the need to fund malaria activities was created.,FMOH
"The highest advocacy point between year one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight was the celebration of the National Social Mobilization Day when the Malaria Control logo was launched by the then Minister of Health, Rear Admiral Jubril Ayinla.",FMOH
The National Technical Committee (on Malaria) was resuscitated in year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight.,FMOH
"The National Malaria Control Committee comprises National, State and some LGA malaria programme managers and officials, as well as representatives from the private sector and international agencies.",FMOH
The committee meets at the end of each calendar year and is responsible for reviewing the activities of the previous year and planning those of the following year.,FMOH
"In year one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight, Training of Trainers activities were carried out on management of severe and uncomplicated malaria.",FMOH
The training programmes were held nationally and in specified zones in the country.,FMOH
It was hoped that such training would produce 12 a core of trainers capable of handling the monitoring and evaluation requirement of malaria activities.,FMOH
The year two thousand witnessed the launching of the African Malaria Day and the adoption of twenty fifth of April every year for the celebration of the day.,FMOH
"In year two thousand and eight, the celebration was accorded global recognition and was re-christened World Malaria Day.",FMOH
"In the last five years, level of advocacy, political awareness and commitment to malaria control in Nigeria have all continued to improve.",FMOH
RBM is an initiative to improve malaria control in the context of Health Sector Reform.,FMOH
"It was initiated in year one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight through a joint partnership of  World Health Organisation, UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank.",FMOH
RBM consists of two phases - the inception phase and the implementation phase.,FMOH
"After the Consensus Building Meeting for countries in West Africa in March year one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine, Nigeria started the RBM inception phase.",FMOH
Workshops were held for executives of media houses to inform them adequately on the technicalities of RBM and its envisaged benefits to Nigerian society.,FMOH
"Nigeria hosted and co-financed the African Heads of State Summit on RBM in April year two thousand, at which forty-four of the fifty malaria-affected countries in Africa where in attendance.",FMOH
Nineteen country delegations were led by the Heads of State while the remaining delegations were led by senior government officials.,FMOH
"The Summit was also attended by the senior officials from each of the four founding agencies ( World Health Organisation, UNICEF, The World Bank & UNDP) and other development partners.",FMOH
The Summit concluded with the signing of the Abuja Declaration and Plan of Action.,FMOH
"The implementation of RBM has started with the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), States and LGAs carrying out specific activities as indentified in the Plan of Action.",FMOH
"Among the several strategies currently available for the control of the disease, one strategy that has been consistently used in the last three and a half centuries is chemotherapy.",FMOH
"Malaria control in Nigeria relies heavily on early recognition, prompt and appropriate treatment.",FMOH
"Resistance to Chloroquine has spread through South America, Southeast Asia to East Africa and eventually to all endemic countries of the continent.",FMOH
A similar but more rapid process has been recorded for SulfadoxinePyrimethamine (SP).,FMOH
"The important consequences of medicine resistance are: an increase in morbidity and mortality, a delay in initial therapeutic response and, an increased cost of treatment to the community.",FMOH
These consequences need to be urgently addressed in Nigeria.,FMOH
"In the same vein, there is an urgent need to preserve and prolong the useful life of the currently available antimalarial medicines.",FMOH
 World Health Organisation guidelines advise policy review when an antimalarial therapeutic failure reaches ten percent.,FMOH
The result of the year two thousand and two Efficacy Studies indicated that Chloroquine and SP were no longer adequate for national first line use.,FMOH
"As a result, further efficacy trials were conducted in year two thousand and four by the Federal Ministry of Health on two suitable Artemisinin based combination therapies.",FMOH
Both combination therapies were found to be highly efficacious and thus suitable for use in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.,FMOH
The mission of National Policy on Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment is to provide optimal diagnostic services in the management of malaria.,FMOH
This includes the use of microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Tests.,FMOH
The content of this document is in line with the content of the Nigerian National Medical Laboratory Policy document (year two thousand and seven).,FMOH
The strategy being adopted seeks to provide adequate laboratory support and capacity building for personnel with appropriate infrastructure facilities at various levels of health care at all tiers of government.,FMOH
Parasitological confirmation is essential in all suspected cases of malaria.,FMOH
"However, where parasitological confirmation is not possible for reasons of implementation, especially in areas of high transmission such as Nigeria, highly vulnerable groups (which include children under five years and those with suspected severe malaria) can be treated on clinical basis.",FMOH
Efforts should be intensified to rapidly expand access to malaria confirmatory services.,FMOH
"During pregnancy, parasitological diagnosis should be promoted to improve the differential diagnosis of fever and reduce the unnecessary consumption of antimalarial medicines.",FMOH
"More particularly, individuals with HIV/AIDS who have fever should be appropriately diagnosed in view of the high incidence of febrile diseases, other than that caused by malaria among these groups.",FMOH
Microscopy is the operational gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria.,FMOH
"In general, microscopy is appropriate at facilities with a functional laboratory and trained personnel (microscopists), usually in hospitals, large medical centres with in-patient care facilities, and in tertiary health care facilities.",FMOH
Rapid Diagnostic Tests are based on the detection of circulating parasites antigens.,FMOH
Quality assured Histidine Rich Protein2 based Rapid Diagnostic Tests is recommended for the diagnosis of malaria in all age groups.,FMOH
Other available Rapid Diagnostic Tests include Plasmodium Lactate Dehydrogenase and Aldolase based.,FMOH
"The handling of Rapid Diagnostic Tests shall be carried out by all health care providers who have been trained to use it in primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities.",FMOH
"Where feasible, the use of Rapid Diagnostic Tests shall be extended to community volunteers who have been specifically trained to perform the task, however, this must be followed up by regular supervision, in addition to measures to maintain field quality assurance.",FMOH
There must be adherence by all concerned (private and public providers) to the minimum standards stipulated for laboratory diagnosis of malaria by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria.,FMOH
"To achieve the goals specified in the policy document, the following would be required:  Relevant diagnostic facilities and infrastructure in health care facilities at various levels of government.",FMOH
Skilled human resources at all levels of health care delivery.,FMOH
Making the coverage of malaria diagnosis an integral part of the National Health Insurance Scheme  health package.,FMOH
"Periodic evaluation through research, surveys, surveillance, DTET, etc and ensuring regular feedback to the programme.",FMOH
"Institutionalizing Quality Assurance Systems for malaria diagnosis throughout the country;  Putting in place appropriate Advocacy, Community Sensitization and Mobilization measures for malaria; and  Providing adequate and sustained funding.",FMOH
Essential antimalarial medicines are those that meet the needs of appropriate antimalarial treatment in the vast majority of the people.,FMOH
"They should therefore be available at all times, in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms and should be affordable to the people.",FMOH
Criteria for Selection:B1856 The criteria for selection of essential antimalarial medicines should be the same as for the selection of essential medicines in general.,FMOH
They are as follows:  The medicines should satisfy the antimalarial treatment needs of the vast majority of the people at all levels of health care.,FMOH
"They medicines should be only those for which there is sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety from local and global controlled clinical studies, as well as from experience in general use.",FMOH
The preferred dosage forms should be those which have a reasonable shelf-life and are able to withstand the inevitable adverse environmental conditions in Nigerias distribution chain.,FMOH
"(For example, tablets and capsules are more stable in the prevailing Nigerias ambient temperatures and humidity than mixtures, syrups and elixirs.",FMOH
"Preferably, therefore, paediatric doses should be achieved from the use of either paediatric tablet strengths or scored tablets of standard tablet strengths.)",FMOH
The list of Essential Antimalarial Medicines: This list is necessarily short since the number of programmatically effective antimalarial medicines globally is quite small.,FMOH
This combination takes advantage of the rapid blood schizontocidal action of the artemisinins and the long duration of action of the partner compound to effect rapid cure with low level of recrudescence.,FMOH
"Artesunate, Artemether, Amodiaquine etc.",FMOH
The use of antimalarial monotherapy medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria is not recommended.,FMOH
Their use significantly increases the risk of development of resistance by the parasites.,FMOH
"Nigeria has complied with these requirements and the countrys regulatory authorities have also stopped further registration of Artemisinin monotherapies and have prohibited the importation, and local production.",FMOH
"In year two thousand and five, the National Administration for Foods and Drug Control (NAFDAC), working in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme discontinued the registration of Artemisinin monotherapies in the country.",FMOH
"In the same vein, NAFDAC has declassified the medicine of choice, Artemether-Lumefantrine and the alternate medicine, Artesunate-Amodiaquine / Artesunate+Amodiaquine from Prescription Only to Over the Counter medicines.",FMOH
Medicines that are no longer Recommended for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria: These are medicines that were previously used on a wide programmatic basis for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.,FMOH
Their efficacy levels have been undermined by the parasite resistance trend observed.,FMOH
Reserved for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy. 2 Chloroquine Inadequate efficacy and therefore no longer recommended ,FMOH
"Treatment Failure This occurs when fever and parasitaemia fail to resolve, or recur within 2 weeks of treatment.",FMOH
It must be confirmed parasitologically preferably by microscopy.,FMOH
The alternate treatment should be given after confirmation has been made.,FMOH
Recurrence of twenty fever and parasitaemia more than two weeks after treatment could result either from recrudescence or new infection.,FMOH
"In such a case, parasitological confirmation is desirable.",FMOH
"However, treatment could be effected with the same medicine administered earlier or the use of alternate medicine.",FMOH
Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy: Pregnant women with symptomatic acute malaria are a high risk group,FMOH
"There is insufficient data on the safety and efficacy of most antimalarial medicines during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.",FMOH
"The antimalarial medicine considered to be safe and recommended for use during the first, second and third trimesters is Quinine salt.",FMOH
"Quinine is administered orally as ten miligram per kilogram body weight to a maximum dose of 60kg body weight, administered every eight hours for seven days.",FMOH
More available evidences have shown that the Artemisinin derivates are safe in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.,FMOH
Artemether-lumefantrine and Artesunate- Amodiaquine are safe and recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria during pregnancy in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.,FMOH
"They can be used in the first trimester, if quinine is not available or compliance to treatment with quinine cannot be assured.",FMOH
Neonates and children less than five kilogram born to mothers in endemic areas are temporarily protected by the partial immunity acquired by the mothers.,FMOH
This begins to wane after the age of three months.,FMOH
Fever in children less than five kilogram should be well defined and treated with oral Quinine when malaria is confirmed.,FMOH
"In the absence of Quinine, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies can be used.",FMOH
Dosing of medicines in these age groups shall be based on weight.,FMOH
Severe malaria is a medical emergency and requires parenteral treatment.,FMOH
"Management of severe malaria should be carried out in secondary facilities with adequate facilities to manage complications or at specialist facility, however, the pre-referral treatment should be administered at the peripheral facility or at home as the case may be.",FMOH
These are mentioned as appropriate in the Treatment Guidelines The list of antimalarial medicines should be a dynamic list.,FMOH
The medicines included should be reviewed regularly for efficacy and safety (pharmacovigilance) to determine their continued usefulness in malaria therapy.,FMOH
At the same time new medicines are becoming available in the country and those that are found to be useful should be added to the list.,FMOH
A network for the surveillance of susceptibility of malaria parasites to antimalarial medicines has been set up in the country.,FMOH
Sentinel sites are being strengthened to generate reports on the performance of specific medicines in the treatment of malaria.,FMOH
Such reports are reviewed regularly by the malaria control authorities.,FMOH
The rational use of antimalarial medicines refers to appropriate use of antimalarials for the right indications and at the correct/adequate dosages.,FMOH
"Antimalarial medicines will be needed for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, severe malaria and chemoprophylaxis for groups at risk.",FMOH
The appropriate use of antimalarial medicines is determined by the goal of treatment and the person responsible for taking the primary decision on use of such medicines either at home or at the different health care levels.,FMOH
"It is the practice, decision and action that occur at this level that influence the management of uncomplicated malaria.",FMOH
"Components of CMM include community education, adequate training of care-givers and the patent medicine vendors and the repositioning of diagnostics, medicines and all other tools.",FMOH
"The effectiveness of community based management will depend upon early diagnosis, prompt and appropriate treatment, and proper health education about malaria.",FMOH
"Early commencement of appropriate treatment will ensure better outcome, and prevent the progression to severe malaria.",FMOH
"An antimalarial medicine to be used at home must be safe, effective, affordable, easy to administer and preferably, in single dosage packs.",FMOH
"All approved Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies come in colour-coded, age specific packs and simple to administer dosage regimen.",FMOH
"At the community level, the Role Model Care Givers and trained Patent Medicine Vendors have been empowered to administered antimalarial medicines, especially in children less than five years presenting with symptoms of malaria.",FMOH
"Diagnosis of malaria in children less than five years at home will depend on proper recognition of symptoms and signs such as fever, vomiting and loss of appetite.",FMOH
The care providers at this level will be trained on the use of malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests to improve diagnosis and also prevent wastage.,FMOH
They will be taught to recognize signs of severe malaria for which they must immediately bring a child to the nearest health facility.,FMOH
Pre-referral services will be improved upon to ensure that patients with possible severe malaria receive pre-referral treatment promptly.,FMOH
Medicines are to be taken every day for three days.,FMOH
"In communities where caregivers have been trained on the administration of Rectal Artesunate, the appropriate dosage should be given as pre-referral treatment.",FMOH
"In all cases, all medicines administered must be appropriately documented in the register provided.",FMOH
"Disease Management in Health Facilities: Levels I, II and III. ",FMOH
"Level I: At the Primary Health Care Centres, Dispensaries and Health Posts, the Village Health Workers, Junior Community Health Extension Workers or trained Patent Medicine Vendors (PMV) belong to this level.",FMOH
Capacity for laboratory diagnosis of malaria at this level is usually limited.,FMOH
"In addition to the treatment of uncomplicated malaria as described above, under community management, a health worker at this level shall give Artesunate suppositories or intramuscular Quinine as pre-referral treatment.",FMOH
"In facilities where there are neither microscopes nor Rapid Diagnostic Tests, malaria diagnosis in children less than five years shall be based on clinical symptoms using the IMCI classification.",FMOH
"The health worker should be able to recognize the general danger signs, give pre-referral treatment such as Artesunate suppositories or intramuscular Quinine and promptly refer patients with severe febrile disease.",FMOH
"Level II: General Hospitals, Comprehensive Health Centres, etc and Private Hospitals staffed by Medical Officers, Community Health Officers or Nurses, At this level, there may or may not be a laboratory.",FMOH
"It is, however, desirable that a laboratory diagnosis of malaria be established when possible.",FMOH
"Detailed history, physical examination and laboratory tests would be employed in the diagnosis of malaria in order to exclude other possible conditions, treatment failure and complications.",FMOH
Rapid Diagnostic Tests shall be provided to compliment microscopy.,FMOH
"Management capabilities would include using alternative antimalarials for failure of response to recommended medicine, providing urgent treatment for severe malaria or other severe febrile illnesses.",FMOH
"Level III: Specialist, Teaching Hospitals and Some Categories of Private Hospitals.",FMOH
"Three categories of patients may be anticipated at this level: patients presenting for the first time, those visiting for follow-up of the same illness, and those referred from other levels that have failed to respond to therapy or have severe complications.",FMOH
"The management of malaria at this level would focus on confirming diagnosis, giving the most effective treatment (including the use of appropriate antimalarial medicines where necessary), providing intensive care for patients with severe complications, and laboratory monitoring.",FMOH
"Therefore, this level must be appropriately staffed and well equipped with needed medicines and laboratory supplies.",FMOH
Level III facilities with units providing primary health care services shall be provided with Rapid Diagnostic Tests in addition to laboratory diagnosis using microscopes.,FMOH
Quality Control mechanisms shall be set up at both Levels two and three facilities.,FMOH
The referral system starts from the caregiver at home who should visit the nearest health facility as soon as there is no perceivable response within two days of commencement of treatment without improvement or when the patient seems to be getting worse.,FMOH
"In general, health providers and health workers at all levels should be able to recognize their limitations and make early referrals.",FMOH
Referral should be a two way process whereby the health worker at the higher health facility also endeavors to give feedback to the lower level health facility on the outcome of the patients management.,FMOH
PREVENTIVE USE OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICINES: Malaria prophylaxis is generally not necessary in persons living in a malaria endemic area because it may slow down the ability of the individual to develop partial immunity which protects from developing the severe form of the disease.,FMOH
"IPTp with SP in Pregnant Women In high transmission areas such as Nigeria, malaria may be asymptomatic during pregnancy.",FMOH
"The use of Intermittent Preventive Therapy with Sulfadoxine- Pyrimethamine has been used for several years in parts of Africa, and has shown to be effective.",FMOH
This is an evidence-based approach and is recommended for all pregnant women.,FMOH
IPT is administered as a one-dose preventive treatment course after Quickening as Directly Observed Therapy and the second dose is given not earlier than one month after the first dose.,FMOH
"Pregnant women who are HIV positive and are on Co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis, should not receive IPT with SP.",FMOH
They should be encouraged to use other preventive measures such as regular use of Long Lasting Insecticide Nets.,FMOH
Children and Adults with Sickle Cell Anaemia: Recent evidences have shown that Proguanil no longer protect individuals with sickle cell anaemia against malaria,FMOH
All individuals with Sickle Cell Anaemia are to sleep under Longer Lasting Insecticidal Nets and also treat all confirmed cases of malaria promptly with Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies.,FMOH
Non-immune visitors to areas of malaria transmission are considered to be at high risk of malaria infection.,FMOH
"In addition to the provision of information concerning effective measures to reduce human mosquito contact, non-immune visitors to Nigeria should also be given chemoprophylaxis.",FMOH
Recommended options for non-immune travelers coming to Nigeria include Mefloquine and Atovaquone-Proguanil.,FMOH
Nigerians who have been away from the country for two or more years to non malaria endemic regions such as Europe tend to lose the partial immunity acquired over the years before travelling.,FMOH
Doses should be taken prior to arrival in Nigeria and continued during stay in Nigeria and following departure from the country.,FMOH
"In spite of this, if an individual develops malaria, a full course of an appropriate antimalarial medicine should be taken and it is advised that the patient visit the nearest hospital.",FMOH
"Although, Artemisinin based Combination Therapies have been deployed for the treatment of malaria in Nigeria because of their proven efficacies, there is need to use all medicines with caution.",FMOH
"Artemisinin based medicines though with good track records of safety, are entirely new in sub-Saharan Africa and have not been adequately studied amongst the indigenous population to determine their safety.",FMOH
"It, therefore, behoves all prescribers and users to report any adverse drug reaction(s) or untoward effect(s) that may be noticed when these medicines are used.",FMOH
The National Malaria Control Programme collaborates with the National Pharmacovigilance Unit of the National Foods and Drugs Administration and Control to build the capacity of health care providers in the country.,FMOH
"In all suspected cases of adverse drug reactions, the Pharmacovigilance form should be completed at all levels of care.",FMOH
It is necessary to complete all section of the adverse drug reaction form before submitting or sent to the Centre.,FMOH
"THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY MONITORING OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICINES: In the last two decades, there has been a widespread resistance to Chloroquine and Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine which had been the first and second line antimalarial medicines respectively.",FMOH
Evidence from the drug therapeutic studies conducted in year two thousand and two in six sites in the country showed a high level of resistance greater than sixty percent for Chloroquine and equally high resistance level for Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine.,FMOH
"In response to this development, the country reviewed its treatment policy and adopted the Artemisinin based Combination Therapies Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria since year two thousand and five.",FMOH
"The increasing rate at which antimalarial medicines have developed resistance over the last few decades has further increased the need for monitoring and establishment of surveillance system, The sentinel sites have also been increased from the initial six to 14 with at least two sites per zone.",FMOH
Drug Therapeutic Efficacy Studies are conducted biennially with seven of the sites used alternatively.,FMOH
The National Programme is upgrading all the sites to Sentinel Surveillance Centres.,FMOH
PROPERTIES OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICINES IN USE IN NIGERIA: The salient pharmacological properties of the antimalarial medicines currently in use in Nigeria are shown in tabular form below.,FMOH
"Except for Chloroquine and Quinine, the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic properties of many of the antimalarial medicines in use in Nigeria have not been studied in-depth in the indigenous population.",FMOH
It is essential that these be done.,FMOH
Artemisinin derivatives All artemisinin derivative medicines are schizonticidal.,FMOH
"Prevent gametocytogenesis by effect on ring and early (stage I and III) gametocyte stages Artemisinins are not are not administered as monotherapies except when used parenterally for the treatment of severe malaria  Absorption: oral very rapid, but may be incomplete.",FMOH
THE MANAGEMENT OF ANTIMALARIAL MEDICINES SUPPLY: Malaria control in Nigeria is anchored primarily on early diagnosis and on prompt and effective treatment of cases.,FMOH
